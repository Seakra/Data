Read the reviews on yelp and definitely wanted to try it. We had brunch here at 2pm this past weekend and it was a stellar experience. The restaurant was beyond packed and busy, yet service was still attentive. The smell coming out of this place is intoxicating.

We had a really nice bottle of Stag's Leap Chardonnay and ordered savory brunch items. We shared theTachinosalata Platter to start (tomato salad, warm hummus, pita, felafel).  I had a spiced Mahi over couscous with preserved lemon and varied chopped ingredients. My friend had the clams and mussels penne special. I ordered a dessert that was offered as a special I believe. It was a lemon greek yogurt with a raspberry coulis. It was delicious. 

The dining room is warm and cozy. Yes, it is tight. Yes, it can be loud. The food is the real star here. Everyone sitting around us had amazing looking food as well.

I was really impressed with this place. I cannot wait to go back. It offers something authentic and special.","2010-12-10 00:22:41"

First time breakfast sandwich (see previous review), another time breakfast sandwiches for my previous employer, 1 time grilled chicken sandwich, 2 times the fried chicken sandwich solo, and meal, and last time was the chicken tender meal. 

I like the Lemonade (5 stars), small upgrade charge if you buy a meal, and they REFILL the Lemonade! I like the waffle iron fries, when they are cooked longer they are 4 stars, otherwise, 2.75 stars. The chicken, it's good, but the servings seem so small with the best being the fried chicken sandwich. I got the 4 pc tenders, and it's like get 6 McNuggets. If the Chicken was organic, it might make a bit more sense, but still would feel pricey. 

I am not a Fan of CFA, and I think the strongest reason is I am a Caniac, eating there at least 1 time per week, sometimes 2x a week for over 1 year now. I always crave it, and I am always happy with what I get. CFA is just okay, last night after getting my tenders, I looked and tasted, and I was 100% craving Cane's, so I went today. If you read my reviews, I have a place that usually adore, and if I go somewhere that doesn't do it like my #1 spot, I have to get to my #1 and get a fix for the experience that was not up to Par! 

At Cane's you get about 4-5 times as much chicken for a MUCH LOWER price! CFA is still busy, and I am not getting it, unless they are just experiencing. I don't see this current busyness as sustainable, and here's why, they close at 9PM daily, and are CLOSED on SUNDAYS! 

I think that's a cool idea, but that reminds me of 30-40 years ago thinking, and I am sure they are losing SERIOUS $$ with this policy, especially in Nevada. We are 24 hour town and 7 days a week, these hours (close at 9PM) and time (M-Sa) don't work. If they change to 24 hours (drive thru) and open 7 days a week, I can see them being a success permanently. Also they need to create a buyer's or VIP club, especially with the small chicken servings.","2017-08-12 06:51:45"

I had to clear my throat loudly to entice someone to come from the back to actually help me.

I was in on a Sunday afternoon and while they weren't busy there were hardly any cupcakes to purchase. I was surprised by the lack of variety despite being there with over 3 hours of business hours left until closing. The two cupcakes I purchased were lemon (for the wife), and a chocolate caramel pretzel combo of some sort. Once I paid for them I was anxious to eat mine. 

I got them home and once we had lunch it was time for dessert. My wife tried hers, one bite was all she took to be done. She said it the icing was too sweet and the cake too dry. I felt the same about my mine. Also, the caramel part in the description was not at all present in my cupcake. It really amounted to overly granulated sugary icing with crushed up pretzel bits on top. The frosting had crusted over so it clearly wasn't fresh. The cake was also dry so it too wasn't fresh. You are a cupcake place, that only makes cupcakes but you can't do that well? Clearly, this just doesn't compute.

Next time, I will save myself from these dry cupcakes and make my own.","2015-03-04 22:24:15"

Customer service was fabulous, all of my questions were answered with honesty, and he was friendly, all without being overly pushy. I went in on a Saturday with a time limit on when I needed the mattress by due to family coming in to town, and my specific mattress had to be ordered. I was promised it would be here in the morning the coming Friday. Well I hadn't heard anything when I had gotten off by 1pm that Friday, called, happened to be CJ there and was informed he had,t heard from the delivery truck. Well okay fine. However, I was holding off doing anything pending this mattress being delivered that day since its delivery on that day was quite important, as well as being what was contractually agreed upon. By 5pm still hadn't heard anything and was quite unhappy. Called again and was told yet again ""don't know, haven't heard."" Nothing to help me. After another hour I called still having heard nothing from the store, and was very upset at this point. To get any sort of response and help, I had to threaten to come get my money back and take it elsewhere to. Suddenly, it was to be delivered within the next 15 minutes. Once we finally got to pick it up he was not friendly, barely helped get it in my truck, and didn't say thank you and shut the back door without so much as saying two words, or apologizing for the inconvenience. An apology goes a long way, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Anyways, a friend and I came here for our bubble tea fix and it was a pretty decent experience. I'd come back, but it wasn't anything extraordinary. 

It was busy in there- like every single table was full type busy. People playing games, eating food, drinking tea, the whole thing. That being said, it was also quite loud but that's what you expect when a place is this popular! I'd like to come back and sit and enjoy myself since I only stayed in there for about 10 minutes. 

I got a honeydew bubble tea and it was good! I also ordered the spring rolls and they were actually really good as well. The price is decent for what you pay for and they have special deals on different days of the week, so on Tuesdays you get cheap green onion cakes if you buy a bubble tea, on Wednesdays you get cheap spring rolls, etc etc. You get the idea. 

The menu is huge and there are tons of options for bubble tea- you can also get iced teas, shaved ice, hot tea. There is an endless amount of options, really. I was also surprised at the amount of food they had on the menu as well! Also, you can get a stamp card here, when you buy nine bubble tea you get the tenth for free which is great for addicts like myself! 

Lots of parking in the parking lot even though it may get quite busy, depending on the time you go. There are quite a few other shops in the complex, which probably contributes to the craziness. If you don't want to bother with the crazy parking lot there's an abundance of street parking close by. 

The service wasn't that great when I went, the girls at the till weren't that friendly but I wasn't super bothered by it since they were so incredibly busy. It took a while for my spring rolls and I went up to the counter to ask for them, and they were sitting behind the counter not being called out. The girl was kind of snippy about it but I didn't really care since I just wanted my food. 

Overall, not bad. Was worth the visit because the bubble tea was delicious, and I'll probably come back some other time, maybe to enjoy a bigger dish or a game.

My friends and I decided on a girls night that began with dinner at Friendlys and ended with a movie close by. We ordered our food at 6pm- so we could leave by 7, for a movie that started at 7:20. None of us ordered anything fancy- chicken fingers, a wrap, a sandwich. At 6:50 our food finally came, and we quickly had to scarf it down in order to leave. (We did let our server know we were headed to the movies after dinner, there was only 5 of us) This was extremely disappointing, even though they offered is boxes to take with us...which honestly, we couldn't even do since we would be at a movie for a few hours. 


We expressed our disappointment to the ""Manager,"" who never even looked up, made eye contact, or engaged in a conversation when we shared with her our experience. All she said was ""I gave you a little something off""- Which was $1.50 off the entire check. It wasn't even the discount that irked me- We were looking for someone to validate and at least pretend they were concerned about our experience, and even that was too difficult to do. 

I would just eat at the theater or head to Red Robbins if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. Apparently, the fry times for Friendlies chicken fingers, fries, etc exceed over 20 minutes.","2015-07-17 14:04:50"

The PM experience was fine apart from higher prices than other whiskey joints in town and bus staff that will take your half full drink more than once. The server didn't want to replace them when he was alerted. It was definitely off-putting.  

The brunch service was less than stellar. The eggs - poached and fried - were a soupy, half raw mess. You always take a gamble with mods but when I ordered the crab benny sans the crab cake because my hungover stomach wasn't particularly feeling seafood, the sever neglected to tell me that he would be bringing me a $10 plate of two soupy poached eggs with sauce.

Every part of the performance was cleverly orchestrated with a great attention to detail.  The Arrival was pleasant, and the Ventilater drink was refreshing and yummy!  Without saying too much about the Ritual itself, I would say to take your time and explore everything.  The actors were wonderful!  The decor everywhere from beginning to end was absolutely fabulous.  The place oozes with real history which we loved.

We got what we came for which was an upscale, spooky experience which was ""night and day"" from Howl-o-Scream which we did the night before.

If I had any constructive criticism it would be that it was a little difficult to follow the plot and ""solve"" whatever the puzzles were leading to ""escape.""  We've done many escape rooms and we are generally good at those sorts of experiences but Vault of Souls might benefit from a little more direction on what is the goal.  

The book of poetry was very nice, and we really enjoyed hanging out in the Gin Joint. will definitely be back next year as this was a value-filled experience!","2015-10-26 12:12:00"

But my first (and likely only) dining experience there was one of those that was tainted by the haze of mood-altering blood sugar levels from ridiculously long wait times which were compounded by loud and obnoxious clientele* that I think the management are letting ruin their establishment. 

In most cases any place is worth a second chance since I know there are always extenuating circumstances: their top server has mono, a shipment of Jerk seasoning is stuck on route 95, they had to physically go slaughter our dinners and the chickens were riled up from the flash mob on South St. But after reading past reviews apparently deplorable service has been the norm since they started riding the coattails of being in the film In Her Shoes. Additionally, even though the curry goat was pretty tasty two hours after I ordered it, I consider the pains I'm still having in my gut 8 hours later as punishment for not trusting my instincts and getting the hell out of there when we first arrived. The back of the house told us to check-in up front, the front told us to check-in out back, a reservation book inside had nothing written in it (funny, considering we all had a few to contribute by then.) All of this should have been a big warning sign.

*In hindsight I realize that the additional charges (listed below) mentioned on page 2 of the menu were most likely created to discourage college kids from coming in to take advantage of the BYOB and 'drinking under the radar' (made obvious by the overly drunk girl who needed help both walking to the bathroom and holding her hair back.) Not only does it ruin the experience for the grown ups who can hold their liquor but it's ineffective and unnerving, especially in a place that seats at least 50 people and has only one bathroom. It's also absurd for already overpriced food, less-than-stellar service, wait times, plastic cups, etc. Then they don't even honor their own fees since the only add-on we were charged was 4 $3 corkage fees, which didn't even add up to what we actually consumed!
- $12 minimum to sit on the patio, 
- 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more, 
- $4 entertainment fee on Fri and Sat nights and a 
- $4 corkage fee for each bottle of wine and six pack

I'd like to follow up on Elsa H.'s review of this place, since I was a member of the family being threatened with police action over trying to purchase a lamp.  I've visited this store many times (it's only a few blocks from our house--we live in the Garden District / Irish Channel), and have had no small share of weird or rude encounters.  Previously, it was decidedly unfriendly looks from the staff, noting encounters with patrons who wanted to keep their purses rather than surrender them at the front counter, etc.  I continued to visit, however, because there's a certain sort of eclectic ""junk pile"" vibe here and some genuinely interesting stuff. This time, the epic unfriendliness of the staff was directed squarely at us, however.

One detail omitted from the previous description of this encounter is when Elsa tried to diffuse the situation with the female owner, the husband (?), rather than trying to also diffuse the situation and (perhaps?) sell something, immediately not only made the ""tell the police to hurry up"" remark  but also tried to throw additional and unrelated fuel on the fire, and blame the kids for breaking things.  Since they were picking vintage comic books for purchase with me, in a different area of the store, and the lamp was on a high shelf elsewhere, that's a little hard to digest.

I'd also like to reinforce how nice it was to have other patrons who were also going to buy things simply leave the store and follow us next door to La Davina (highly recommended gelato) to discuss what happened.

If you're visiting New Orleans and looking for antiques, I strongly encourage you to check out the other offerings on Magazine St.  If you're a local, I think it's obvious that except possibly as an anti-gentrification move, we really don't want a visitor's experience on the otherwise fantastic Magazine St. stretch to include this sort of abuse.  And finally, if you're considering consigning your merchandise to be sold by this store, I encourage you to first be an observant ""customer"", and decide if you believe anything will actually be sold at all, given the attitude of the owners.  There are better choices. 

Please don't support this horrible store.  And in summary, it's unfortunate that Yelp doesn't allow zero-star reviews.","2014-06-11 15:32:33"

Preservation Hall continues to preserve and showcase fresh jazz musicians, who pay homage to the jazz greats of yesteryear. 

The have shows nightly at 8, 9 & 10. They also have special showtimes, like when I attended, at 6pm. Tickets are $30 and $40 for VIP seats, which can be purchased in advance on their website. Alternatively, you can get General Admission seating for only $15 (once doors open only). However, here's the real deal: to get the ""cheap seats"" you should arrive at least 30 minutes prior to showtime. That's when the line starts forming for those tickets. Plus, you're not guaranteed a seat, and most likely, you'll be standing. But for $15 and great, live music, it's totally worth it for the 45 minute show. 

The good news is that the music sounds the same, whether seated or not. My preference is General Admission seating. Once I'm in, I sit on the window sill at the very back of the room. This hidden seating also doubles as a place to stand to see it all, when the band is really jamming.

I ordered a St. Louis Style Ribs and Brisket and Mac N Cheese. The Ribs were tasty, with a nice bark and smokey flavor, but were a little on the puny side as far as meat. I opted for the St. Louis style instead of the Baby Back's just for that reason. The brisket was very tender, but didn't have a deep flavor that i was looking for.  It helps they have 6 different sauces to choose from. The mac n cheese was good too, and it had corn in it, which was very unexpected, but tasty none the less. Overall the ribs are thing to get here....","2010-07-12 20:48:51"

They had a package with the Sketch Players. It's a great idea dinner & a show. It was not understood exactly at first that the show wasn't there we had to go someplace else but that was ok. 

All the people that were there for the dinner & show made it rather loud. It has a quaint ambiance hence the name it was a train station. With the old fashioned high ceilings & tile floors made it hard for conversation. Also the large glass windows made it unbearable to see with a low setting bright sun. So if any thought could be put into some acoustical tiles or some sun glare help with the glass without taking away from the charm it would be a bonus.

Onto the food....
I had the Herb Encrusted Sirloin of Beef 
Sliced tenderloin served on a bed of wild mushrooms topped with the chef's signature béarnaise sauce it was very good. The beef was tender but could have used a few more potatoes. I got 2 wedges. Maybe even a mashed potatoes??

My husband had Stuffed Salmon Florentine 
Fresh farm raised salmon stuffed with crabmeat and baby spinach, lightly dusted with ritz crackers and topped with hollandaise sauce. He said it was ehhh ok I tasted it,  It was awful according to me. It was like a Mrs Paul's frozen something or other.
I would think even if they did a fried flounder or something there it would be better then this frozen item they just stuck in the oven.
There was a mix up with our order. We were there for this large event so the restaurant was packed with trying to get us to the show on time they somehow missed our ticket. The manager came over & apologized & then our order came out quickly. Which may or may not have attributed to the fish maybe not being done. It wasn't hot it was only room temperature. We would try it again on a less busy night to consider possibly a better rating. However, we probably still wouldn't recommend the fish!","2013-04-14 17:19:42"

Now I'm not normally picky about ambiance, but the floors were covered in something slick and the place just looked dirty. A trip to the restroom to wash up sealed the deal. It was filthy. 
We ordered the vegetable samosas, which were quite good, but we only got two, with no plates on which to eat them. Next came the Bollywood dosa and Grandma's dosa. I guess I'm just used to a different style of dosa, but these barely had any filling, and the bread was not as crispy as I'm used to. 
After waiting for about ten minutes for our check, a waiter finally came and we had to ask for a check before he told us that we should pay up front. At least, that's what I think he said.

as for the food; my sister had ordered the clam chowder and she had to send it back and asked them to reheat it because it wasn't even warm, it was room tempature. than between the 5 of us we had ordered other dishes and 20 wings (4/person) well there was definitely 20 piece of chicken on the plate; if you count the one tiny piece that looks like the very tip of the chicken wing that usually gets thrown out. 
when we brought it up to the waiters attention; after having to look for him for 15 mins, his response was the chefs usually cooks a big batch at a time so they probably miscounted so he'll bring us another wing. we waited another 15 minutes before finally getting his attention to ask for our check and a couple boxes. so by now we have leftovers all packed up and money in the check sleeve ready for the waiter to take. i wanted to leave a feedback with the manager on duty there about our meal so I asked a waitress to get the manager for me since our waiter wasn't around. now we are pretty much ready to leave and the one piece of wing never came out; that is until our waiter overheard us asking for the manager. because as soon as the manager got to our table so did the one piece of chicken wing soaked in oil. 
when we told the manager about the wings he pretty much brushed it off and laughed in our face and said ""I guarantee the chefs didn't count this as a wing"" and that ""they probably just shorted you guys a wing and so someone else here got that extra wing"". it was 20 wings for $20 so his solution was telling us he'll take a dollar off our bill if we wanted. 
i felt like that was a slap to my face and I felt a little discriminated, like if I wasn't asian things would've been different. I wasn't looking for any type of discount or freebie, all i wanted to do was give a feedback to the manager so he knows they should be more careful since this wasn't the first time they ""miscounted"" (in the past I've been shorted on wings and shrimps)

(That is -- you'll feel heavier, but your wallet will feel a lot lighter.)

Stopped by here on a visit to Lumiere Place; figured it was worth a shot.  Didn't know anything about the pedigree of the chef or the place -- just that it was in the casino, I was hungry, and I was there.  Seated quickly (it was late in a Wednesday evening and pretty dead).  Server was attentive, patient to answer the questions I had, and was pretty efficient.

First thing you'll notice when you open the menu - yeah.  Pricey, even for a gourmet burger joint.  You can either build your own burger (starting with a base at around $10 and adding on for extra ingredients ranging from truffles and caramelized onions to good ol' fashioned bacon and cheddar), or pick one of the select ones.  Those come with fries, so there's a slight savings there, since fries are separate for the main burgers.

The fail here is that the burgers are about 75% the size of what you'd expect to get at the local burger hut.  That wouldn't ordinarily be a problem, except that the prices are about 25% higher than what you'd expect to pay at a gourmet/specialty burger place.  Yes, yes, this place is inside of a casino, so you'd expect it to be a little pricier, but it just seemed like it was a premium price for what turned out to be an OK meal.  

This is a place to stop by if you're going to spend a night at the casino with friends and want to have something fun and cool to eat before a night of gaming.  It's not a place to stop by after you're done and looking for something casual and cheap to end the evening.

I think the 3 stars is generous; the staff made up for this visit being kind of disappointing.  I can see where this place would be appealing; it just wasn't what I had in mind as a visitor.  Now I know better.","2012-03-01 04:51:57"

Most of the staff was friendly; one suggested we take their shuttle to the airport, which is across the street and then shuttle from there to one of the casinos. As we were carless, this was much appreciated. The free ice was helpful, as we kept a nice ice chest with plenty of drinks and the soaps, shower, fridge were much appreciated. The pressure on the water was a little much for my toddler but I enjoyed it. Knocked off a star because the pool was only open for a limited time. I wish I could have enjoyed maybe a few extended hours during my trip there. Pool closes at 10 and with the busy schedule we had, we never made it over there. Also, while most staff was friendly there were some glaring front desk staff that made this place seem quite stuffy and unwelcoming for us. We paid over $600 for the three nights we were there.

I have seen many films at the International House. I can feel they really love film and respect the many mediums of film. Films are usually shown in the original medium in which they were recorded. This makes for a much different experience than watching the films at home. 

The theater is clean and the seating is stadium seating. They hold film festivals and show many rare and foreign films. I've been here multiple times where they have difficulty starting a film. I'm not sure if that is because of the medium or because they aren't prepared.

This seemed manipulative and ethically ambiguous to me.

I have extensive damage to my teeth due to previous medical issues, leaving me with fragile molars and infection. I also have a strong phobia of dental work, so I figured that Dr. Dubin would be right for me. I was wrong.

His staff are quick, efficient, friendly, but as I continued consultation and treatment, something seemed a bit off about them. Dr. Dubin has a MA in psychology (I am also working on my psychology degree) so I figured that would be of added benefit for my fear of dental work. I was wrong.

I was told to have an extensive cleaning done, and to pay all costs upfront. It was approximately 500 dollars, after they discounted $100 for the sedation. I went for the consult, nervous and scared, and by myself, which was a huge mistake- if you're in a state of fear, your ability to make decisions is compromised. I was in pain from infection, but they said they would delay the cleaning and treatment, as they would not do a procedure without the money upfront. This was the only dental office I encountered which was reluctant to set up a payment plan for someone with active tooth pain and an abscess.

I pay the money over two weeks, and come to the office with my fiance. I was given the sedative, and was brought to the back. I was still anxious, but I closed my eyes and did my best to help the medication work. I clearly heard what was going on. All of a sudden, a sharp pain broke me from my state- he had injected a stimulant under my tongue to help me wake up- without ever telling me what he was doing. I've worked in patient care- without exception, you tell every patient- regardless of assumed state of consciousness- what you will be doing, especially if it is painful. 

I had a massive panic attack as I felt the unexpected injection, and my fiance walked to the room as he heard me, and Dr. Dubin kept insisting I was fine, while making a superficial effort to calm me down. After I calmed down, we left the office, and went home to recover from the sedative. 

The office called and emailed me a few times to convince me to return, and I mistakenly tried to rationalize Dr. Dubin's behavior- maybe I was overreacting? After all, the staff was incredibly friendly, and the infection in my molars wasn't going away. I went back, and in doing so, explained to Dr. Dubin why I was upset about my previous visit- the sedative wasn't fully in effect by the time they brought me back, he attempted to justify his actions,

He asserted that I was too sedated (I was still able to hear everything going on), but did not deny that he administered the injection without telling me. He then worded his apology as ""I'm sorry that you feel that way"" instead of apologizing for his poor bedside manner, and quickly left the room to leave me with a staff member for a financial consultation.

For two molars to be crowned and an implant, they quoted me in the $15,000+ range. My teeth nearly fell out of my mouth at that point. I asked if that included what my insurance would cover, as they said the initial cleaning was not covered by insurance, and I found out that they were not a participating provider with my insurance. Admittedly, I should have called my insurance company to verify their status as a participating provider, but up until I asked directly, was not answered directly.

At this point, I was in tears- my mouth was in constant pain, my finances could NOT afford it, and I wasn't qualifying for any of their loan programs. The woman, though friendly, seemed like she was taking advantage of my fear and pain to get me to make an extremely expensive purchase- all upfront, of course. 

The final straw the broke the camel's back was when she suggested I take out a payday loan. If you're unfamiliar with payday loans, they are predatory loan agencies which give you the money upfront, but charge up to 200% to 2,290% interest. I'll let you do the math.

I left, upset, and they finally offered to contact another dentist they knew (who also didn't take my insurance) and kept asserting that my dental health was more important than my finances. From the dentist who can afford the leased building in Rittenhouse Square.

Dr. Dubin may seem like he cares about you, especially if you're in pain and need a lot of work done. If you can't afford it, they will try to pressure you into making poor financial decisions, skate around insurance questions, and dismiss you if you decide their prices are more than you can afford.

I have found a more professional dentist who has since saved me mountains of money, while treating me like a human- not an open pocket with teeth.","2013-10-09 17:47:07"

Pros: Our guide was great, very knowledgable and had lots of great facts to share. The  gear was great and kayaks themselves were well taken care of and easier to handle than others.  Was expecting just a simple Deli lunch, but was surprised to get salads, wraps, fresh fruit, chips and cookies that were all pretty good!  Kayaking under Stern's Pier was a unique perspective and fun. 

Cons: We felt that the tour wasn't really as advertised.  Website says the whole tour would go from 10-2.  In reality, we didn't start with instructions until about 10:15 and didn't get into the water until closer to 11. We weren't too worried about the delay once were told we'd be back between 2 and 3, however, we were back on the landing at 1:55, pretty disappointing. The ""secluded beach"" was actually the Leadbetter Beach, which is next to Santa Barbara Yacht Club...which is about 1/2 a mile from the Sea Landing. 

We did enjoy ourselves, the conditions were good, and our guide was great, but it definitely wasn't what we thought we were signing up for and would not recommend this company to others.","2016-07-05 22:46:52"

BYOB & no corking fee. Everything is delicious, but if I had to put in order of what I thought was amazing to great: Bloody Beet Steak, Salted dark chocolate napoleon, Spice encrusted trout and new jersey risotto with lions mane mushrooms. I can't say for sure where the roasted winter vegetable salad sits within the list since it wasn't my main dish - but I would say top 3. 

The details:

The boyfriend and I decided to have one nice dinner while enjoying an impromptu weekend vacation to Philly. Neither of us had been before and this was truly a highlight of the weekend.

Bloody Beet Steak: Holy Beets. This set the tone for the rest of the meal. This was perfectly balanced - sweet, acidic, fresh, light...I wanted to bury my face into this dish. It's been a while since I've wanted to lick a plate clean. But luckily they give you brioche buns and butter in the beginning so I used that as a vessel into my mouth. 

Roasted Winter Vegetable Salad: It was a hard choice between this and the Beets for me, but luckily my boyfriend got it which was also surprising because he doesn't normally like cauliflower. So is it wrong that I was hoping that he just hated the taste so much that I could have two first courses? Unfortunately for me, he found it delicious and so I was only blessed with the tiniest of bites as he scraped up the rest of the vegetables. The bite was just as well balanced as the beet steak and to be honest, if I could eat vegetables like this more often I think I could be a vegetarian.

New Jersey Risotto with lion mane mushrooms: I'm sure this was possibly called something else, but I remember specifically the waiter mentioned that the risotto comes from Jersey and the lion mane mushrooms came from a local farm near philly. The risotto was done perfectly, and had bits of black truffle along with the lions mane mushroom. The taste of the mushroom

Spice encrusted trout: I'm always hesitant about spice encrusted things. Like, is it going to be overly salty/browned/overpowering that it destroys the flavor of which it is encrusting? But I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. The spice that encrusted the trout was coarsely ground so it gave a beautiful contrast to the meaty fish. The parsnips below were so delicious and sweet which went well with the whole dish.

Salted Dark Chocolate Napoleon: Whenever I go to restaurants, my thought is always ""yes to chocolate"" regardless of how full I am. This isn't your traditional napoleon, the phyllo dough was crispy thin and touched with honey sitting layered between salted dark chocolate mousse topped with white chocolate cream encircled by a caramel sauce. It was exactly what I needed at the end and was surprisingly light.

Bonus points: The chef worked at one of my favorite restaurants in NY.","2015-01-04 23:16:30"

Every time I've stopped in since then, there's always a contingent of knitters purling away at a table.  The ladies at the counter are always happy to help you select yarn, patterns from the huge library of patterns in the back or to print you off a free one from their system.  They have a nice selection of monthly classes as well as private lessons and one day, when I'm not so slammed at work, I hope to take a lace knitting one.

The store is neat & tidy and the shelves are stocked with a lot of yarn selections.  As a previous reviewer noted, there is a large amount of acrylics available, but there's a lot of luxury as well.  Ah, mohair - how you call my name and fuzz my shirts during projects...

Long overdue in writing this review. Have been to Lulu's a number of times--it's a close walk for us but somehow avoids some of the touristy scenes--hint they don't stand outside and solicit you to come eat there. 

So, let me give you the run down on how to order well at an Italian pizzeria: chianti, fiesta salad, pizza margherita, (both with homemade mozzarella!) finished with espresso.

Order some chianti by the glass--happy hour specials have been in action every time we go for late lunch.  Next, the Fiesta salad--perfect to share with two--is delicious with homemade fried zucchini spears, arugula and roasted red peppers. Add a pizza margherita to this order and you and your date are in Italy having an almost real Italian pizza.--sorry nothing actually comes close to the real thing, but this experience is the most accessible IMO and I lived in Italy.  At the end of our last pizza date, the very nice Italian man whose service is continental in every way (read non-obtrusive!) came to check on us.  When we asked about espresso, he looked at me as if to say, ""but of course!""  (I didn't see a big espresso machine so I thought they didn't have it.)  I'm not trying to over build it--it's just going for pizza, but if you want good pizza, this guy makes his own homemade fresh mozzarella--which just makes the pizza margherita.

Okay, add to all that two things:  

1.  Great space for large crowd with teens, vegetarians, etc.  (non-fussy, not super expensive for family crowd, everyone is happy)

2.  We just ordered delivery  tonight and hello under 30 minute delivery!  Great way to serve up great salad and pizza at home with no fuss.

We love you Lulu's! Hope you stay where you are in Old City for good!","2012-05-03 01:27:58"

I rarely order burgers (no pun intended!) when I go out to eat, because they're usually low quality and not cooked to my liking; Plus, typically there are just other menu items that appeal to me more. But this one...Juicy, grass fed beef, medium rare, topped with the best bacon I have ever had, on the most deliciously grilled egg bun...And I didn't even order the burger, my dining buddy did! The burger was so large he couldn't finish it, so I got to have several bites of it myself. It's definitely what I will always remember most about Home Wine Kitchen, at least until my next visit!

For myself, I ordered the ""Lunchbox,"" which is a revolving lunch special that, for $14, includes a beverage, lunch special of the day, and dessert. Not too shabby. The lunch special the day we were there was a tuna nicoise salad, and it was also excellent. The dessert was a chocolate cake with fresh berries that definitely did not disappoint. 

Since our visit took place during lunch on a Saturday, we ordered a couple of adult beverages with our meal. I had a fantastic cider, and he tried a beer called White Rascal that I called ""the best Belgian white beer I have ever had."" So yum. 

Service was attentive, and the decor was much more robust than when a restaurant called Nosh last occupied the space. However, the main dining area isn't very large (maybe 8-10 tables). I was surprised to see how busy it was for a random Saturday afternoon. There's a large back staircase you can see from the main dining area that apparently leads to a private event space upstairs. We didn't go up there, but this place seems like it would be perfect for a birthday party, shower, or other special event. Also, the location can't be beat, and with some recent closures, I'm glad to see a new restaurant in Maplewood.

Ever since Target hit the scene I really have to ask, ""Who even goes to Kmart anymore?"" I asked this to myself out loud the other day as I had to get my meds filled due to a sinus infection. No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.

This store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's ""Whitewashed.""  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?

One great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.

The extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!

The later 80s quote, ""K-Mart sucks"", remains as true as ever and who knows, you may even bump into someone who still dresses from that Tom Cruise era who cares about male panty line. One never knows?","2012-03-31 12:55:01"

The pool was decent, just your basic rectangle and nothing fancy. The room itself was nice and a average hotel room. It seemed clean and the bed was comfy. I had an issue with the toliet and the deadbolt on the door at some points but nothing major. Also the water pressure in the shower was HORRIBLE. I ended up only using it once so I'm unsure if it was a one time thing or just because there was a lot of water use going on at the time. It also took about 3-5 minutes for the water to heat up and get hot. The cleaning staff was excellent and cleaned our room twice during our four nights. The free wifi was spotty. In my room I got only 2 bars and ended up resorting to use data most of the time, but other spots in the hotel had full bars.
 BREAKFAST-
On the weekends it ends at 10am and during the week it ends at 9am. I (and a few other guests) were not aware of the change (as it was not posted anywhere and when we checked in, the front desk all told us that it ended at 10am) We came in around 9:10am on a Monday morning to eat breakfast. There were still things out on the tables and one worker who was cleaning stuff. She proceeded to come out and yell and mumble to herself while cleaning up the breakfast that we were 'ridiculous' and needed to 'read the damn hours'. At this point I just grabbed the rest of my breakfast to-go and awkwardly walked out of the room. The same worker was there every morning sitting in the back 'kitchen' making phone calls most of the time and frequently forgot to upkeep the breakfast food/area. At one point I saw her mixing pancake batter in the sink...
Overall the food was average, some type of egg and meat, bread, muffins, pastries, waffles/pancakes, coffee, juice, cereal etc. it didn't taste bad, and overall it got the job done.

I guess I would stay here again. Definitely not for a long amount of time, but maybe for a one-night stop. It's nothing fancy but it will do the trick.","2017-08-23 01:29:09"

This was a fun choice although next time I will likely just do a board where we choose our own meat and cheese. The poutine was also pretty good. We had champagne and wine which were obviously good. I also ordered a tequila drink, Comfortably Numb, that was good and somewhat different.. it was a little smoky and citrus. My favorite part was the live music.

And it would still be ok if she gave me a reasonably good haircut. But she didn't.

Then, here's the clincher: I was taken back to the spa area for my brow wax, and to my surprise I had one brow done by a student (I forget what they're called - the people who don't cut hair) and one done by a hair student who said she ""really likes waxing."" It took about 40 minutes and they were uneven AND they left lots of stray hairs. Most concerning was the fact that the lights were dim and they didn't use any kind of light. I do better with my own tweezers at home.

Ordered the Mega Mary for an app, and my wife and I split it. Granted, it wasn't the right time for it, but we just had to try it. Glad we did, they make their own mix and topped it with a strip of bacon, a pickled string bean, and two bleu cheese stuffed olives. Their cocktail selections were great. In fact, they had an entire page for just martinis. 

Ordered the local ravioli with chicken and the filet with kale and sweet potatoes for our mains. Got the chowder which was great, not the creamiest but I'm okay with that. The mains were very tasty and rather large...probably too large for one person. The steak was cooked to perfection. 

As if we weren't stuffed enough, we had to order another cocktail for dessert, can't remember the name but it had vanilla ice cream and tasted like a milk shake.

I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before we booked this hotel!  We booked it because it was one of the few in our price range with free parking and it was a last min decision to visit Nashville.

Upon check in, we were greeted with a smile and warmth.  The lobby was nice and updated.  The front desk girl asked us if we preferred a floor and inside or outside room for our King (they have rooms with entrance on the inside like a hotel and on the outside like a motel-weird).  She gave us a map of how to find our room and we were on our way.

First off, there is only one elevator, it's slow and it's the only way up and down with suitcases if you don't want to carry them.  Upon entering the area with the elevators, we noticed it wasn't so nice inside anymore.  Hesitantly, we went to our room on the third floor-outside (figured maybe less foot traffic).  The door to the room was all dented and painted half assed and chipping.  As soon as we walked in the room, it smelled horribly strong of bug spray-There was no hiding it, but we tried with my body spray anyway and turned the ac/fan on right away.  We had been driving five hours, so at this point we just wanted food and to lay down for a bit.

After having dinner down the street, we came back to the room to get ready to go explore and the toilet clogged-#1 TP minimal- and it OVERFLOWED all over the bathroom floor into the foyer of the sink onto the carpet (sink is NOT in the bathroom-tub&shower are separate).  I called the front desk asking for maintenance to come with a plunger and towels and they send housekeeping with extra towels & doesn't speak English to understand what we needed, so we had to show her.  About 10 mins later the maintenance man came, unclogged and called housekeeping back up to clean. He said he had just unclogged one right down the hall, second one in less than an hour.  He was very nice and lighthearted about it, but didn't seem concerned.  Housekeeping came back up and cleaned.  Total fiasco from start to finish was about 25mins.  After all that, I called the front desk to cancel our second night in the room and booked another hotel downtown to get out of the nasty place for the next night. We couldn't cancel and leave then without losing $180!  When I asked to cancel the second night and told the lady what just happened with the toilet, she didn't even offer a discount or to move rooms-just said ""ok, it's noted-please check out in the am."" 

At dinner we realized this hotel is not close to ANYTHING we wanted to do, that is when we discussed booking the $300 room downtown and all of those things happening after dinner, it just sealed the deal to get away from this place.  After settling down a bit in the nasty hotel, we decided to try the restaurant in the hotel as it had good Yelp reviews. We just went down for desserts, drinks & heard live music playing. It was amazing, we recommend that place!

When we got back to our room, I turned the ac down from earlier when we entered and tried to cover the bug spray with my body spray, I noticed there was MOLD all over the vent of the ac and my husband noticed an extra ""popcorn ceiling"" sprayed area where it had leaked.  We didn't want to stay there so badly that we shared my one pillow I brought in fear of using theirs.  Needless to say, we didn't really sleep. Not that we could with the traffic from the highway, people walking by all night and the loud banging all around.

8am came and we were up and headed downtown to the Hyatt Place Hotel.  I tried to fix myself up enough to just hurry to leave and the plug in by the sink didn't work. Anytime I plugged something in, the gfi outlet kept ""blowing"".  The shower also clogged with water to my ankles when I showered the night before. 

Gotta say, I hope Marriott realizes what they bought and what they stamped their name to with this place. They tried to update it in the rooms, but it was cheap and gross. Too many shortcuts for costs and not enough class doing it.  I wouldn't stay at this hotel if it were the last one in Nashville. I'll sleep in my car. I can't believe we WASTED $180 for a night in this place. We stayed in a Crowne Plaza for $140 in Los Angeles and it was like the Mansion spa resort compared to The Inn being a dumpster behind an old restaurant.  Classless disappointment.","2016-10-01 04:55:38"

The only downside is the food. The bar serves good snacks but you can only have flatbread for dinner so many times. They sell a decent variety of snack in the lobby 24-7 too, but again, not dinner.

To me, I wouldn't even call it sauce on most of them. It was more like oil, grease or the like. They didn't taste too bad. The parmesan wings didn't taste as good as they looked, but it was so-so for me. On my three visits there, I had the ten wings combo (with fries and drink). The supposedly hot wings weren't as spicy (sorry guys I've had better...). The crinkle cut fries were alright as well. I did use them to dip into the leftover wing sauce on the plate. Which brings me to a point: this is probably the first wing place that I visited that doesn't offer dipping sauce (like ranch and blue-cheese). But I got by.

We had friends in from out of town this weekend and were really pressed as to where to go because they were tired and we didn't want to go into the city. Chestnut Hill has nothing worth talking about and we didn't want to go to a place with bar food.

First of all it is really beautiful inside. The atmosphere is fun, yet elegant. The female bartender is so knowledgeable. She is truly a breathe of fresh air. We started with a few of the signature cocktails which were made with fresh house squeezed juiced and mixers (unheard of) and they were delicious. No, they are not the $6 crappy drinks from the bars in Ambler, but they are not using Ocean Spray either. I had a French 75 which was knock your socks off, out of this world and my friend had a pumpkin something or other, which quite frankly I would not have ordered because I don't like sweet, but it was actually delicious and not sweet at all! The others had two tried one of the wines by the glass and a craft beer on draft. 

They have home made chips at the bar and they are so addictive I had to move them away. We did wait past our reservation by about 15 mins for the table, but I called late for our table and it was a Saturday night. We didn't mind because the atmosphere at the bar was so enjoyable.

The dining room was relaxing. the chairs were comfy. the service was friendly and good. Appetizers were all very good - Salmon Tartar, Carmelized Brussel Sprouts (never a fan-I am now-crazy but true??), grilled ceasar and a clam something or other than was incredible! Entrees were Salmon, Hanger Steak, Halibut, and Scallops ans Gnocchi - everything was perfect. Too full by dessert but we did move on too bar for...drum roll Absinthe!!

It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  

I am a fan!  This place doesn't quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!","2017-08-16 15:51:51"

It was 100 degrees outside and we needed to cool off and relax after driving up from Maryland. There was no relief in our room even though the thermostat said 60. They brought up two box fans when we asked so that helped a tad but when we're staying in a $400 rm hotel, I expect a comfortable room. Even room service noticed it was extremely hot and we should keep fighting. It was cooler in the hallway.

PROs:
- 1/2 mile from Liberty Bell and attractions 
- cool hotel, different from Marriott that's right across the street 
- cool bar, food served till midnight 
- 24 Hr room service 
- pay as you drink bar in the room
- the manager was nice enough to comp us all fees outside of the room charge (parking, meals, etc)
- valet gave us cold bottled waters after asking how our stay went
- Starbucks across front door 

CONs:
- older hotel with a ton of floors 
- not the Marriott with all of its newer features like A/C
- tough to pump the A/C up to the 17th floor especially when it's a million degrees outside 
- they were willing to move us rooms but the only one available was a double bed and the air wasn't much cooler, not worth the move
- they said engineers were working it but they never came to our room 
- foyer and elevators smell old and musty
- valet-only parking is on 12th St: $48/night with in/out privileges 
- no fridge except for bar fridge, we shoved our leftover cheesesteak sandwich in there

Secondly, our table was not wiped down after each course, something commonly done at restaurants of this calibre. Additionally, the fish dishes our table ordered (specifically the trout, and the mackerel), were a bit bland.  

On the positive side, I was blown away by the rigatoni I ordered as my main course. It was wonderfully spiced and had something in it that gave it a crunchy texture. Splendid!

However I was told since it was only 3 of us that we could not use the voucher. 
This did not make any sense because they could have prorated the coupon for 3 people at $12.50 each.
 However I believe the restaurant's motivation for allowing us to leave without the using voucher, is that they want each party to spend more money. Therefore if we used the voucher we would not go over the $50 limit.
They will also only allow certain menu items to be consumed with the voucher. Maybe Groupon shouldn't allow Erawan to advertise.
They displayed poor customer service and has not won me over!
They would not engage me in the conversation and could care less that they lost customers.

I left there and went to Banana Leaf at 1009 Arch Street. The food at Banana Leaf was excellent and the service was superb.

This hotel is recently renovated, which is nice, and the workout room and breakfast area were above average. I have 5 stars to this review however for one of the front desk employees, Daisy. 

The second night of my stay, I dropped an earring in the bathroom and it landed behind the sink fixture. I tried to no avail to get it out, so I went downstairs to ask if maintenance could come and see if they could retrieve it. Daisy called for backup and went up to my room with me, prepared for anything. She got a broom and different size paintbrushes to try and help in pushing the earring from the tight spot, and laid down on the floor with me with a light shining to see if we could find it. (All of this is happening at 10:30 pm, mind you). 

Together we still couldn't get it out, so she left a note for maintenance and showed them herself the following day where the earring was, all while I was in Tampa Bay at a conference for work.

I love the decor, love the couches on the porch for waiting, love the large patio and the fact that it's dog friendly.  I love the wallpaper on one wall for the banquette tables, and most of the menu looks interesting.

The problem is, that's not enough.
We arrived at 4 PM on a Saturday, and there were about a half dozen staff about and four customers at two different tables.  The hostess greeted us promptly enough, but she first tried to seat us at a table right at the front door, then the table adjacent to that in the middle of the room.  Did you recall I mentioned there were only two occupied tables in the place at the time?

When I asked for a banquette table (only one was occupied), she asked if we could wait while they cleaned off one towards the back that was a 4 top.  That was fine, we didn't ask for a 4 top but it was preferred... and that table along with the other two 4 tops that were not in the front door were dirty.  At least we noticed fairly soon after that the clan of servers cleaned off the other dirty tables, I guess preparing for dinner crowds, just makes you wonder why they waited.

So we're seated after some cleaning, and immediately upon sitting down the quietest server I've ever had approaches and asks what we'd like to drink.  The drink menu is a full page small type, so I just ordered a water while I pondered.  Thought about noting this place is only 4 months old... are you that used to regulars?  He came  back three different times as we were talking and hubby had to take a phone call... I'm not 100% sure what he said each time because again... quietest server ever.  Our receipt says his name is Oscar.

Opted for an autumn sangria ($12) as did hubby and we ordered some Pub Rolls ($9) as a starter.  The sangria was OK, but not very fruity and not overly special - esp not for $12 each.  The app was quite good, think Mexican inspired egg rolls.

About the time our appetizer arrived, a huge storm that had been brewing washed over the restaurant and completely obscured the windows... I'm so glad we had rejected that front door table.

For dinner, I had the Harvest Pig sandwich ($16) with sweet potato fries and hubby had Fish & Chips ($16).  My sandwich had way too much bread for the meat portion, and the other accompaniments mentioned were barely evident.  The fries were OK... but a bit chunky and limp for my taste.  Hubby said the fish was good, but their tartar sauce and randomly ranch sauce both are strong on dill.... which he dislikes and does seem odd in tartar sauce.

Portion sizes were generous, neither of us finished our meals but we did order the BACC to go because of some yelp mentions and the fact that I love peanut butter.  Really love peanut butter.  I asked our super quiet server was BACC stood for, and he sheepishly wouldn't say the words ""Big Ass"" that precede ""Chocolate Cake"" for this dessert offering.  The cake was the biggest disappointment, and at $12, especially disappointing.

Maybe I read the menu wrong, but I thought the cake was chocolate cake filled with peanut butter and iced with peanut butter icing.  Sounded fabulous - but not what I got.  It was definitely chocolate, and if it's possible it was super rich but not super good.  I wouldn't have thought that was possible prior to trying the BACC.  There was no hint of peanut butter anywhere, and the chocolate cake seemed blah, and the chocolate icing was joined by chocolate syrup and chocolate chips on the outside, joined by ice cream.

While it was too much even for two people, and it wasn't the worst dessert I've ever had, but it is possibly the first restaurant dessert where I've ever thrown out the uneaten portion.

Dinner above with the two sangrias was $82 plus tip.  In our world, that's a nicer dinner but not five star.  The problem is normally when you pay that you get a meal that's memorable for positive reasons, and I can't say that happened.

We will at some point go back, probably when it's warmer and probably for a burger on the patio with our pup tagging along.  Maybe I'll feel differently after that, but for now, not in a hurry for that second chance.","2017-11-20 00:22:14"

They immediately poured me a drink and asked the Chef to open the kitchen early to cook me a meal. After they also invited me to try a new wine they were considering adding to the menu. They went above and beyond for me during a time they were not supposed to be working simply because they knew I was dealing with a stressful situation. Acts of kindness like this are rarer than gold.

I love it when that happens!  We shared an ap of little crab claw sticks, which I know sounds incredibly unappealing but I can't remember what they called them.  Basically they left the toe on and removed the rest of the shell off the meat- and then breaded and fried.  Envision a mozzarella stick- only its crab. Delightfully easy to eat!  I wish the crab had been a bit sweeter but that's what we get in the Midwest.  

We then shared a summer salad which was full of summer veggies- different pole beans, beets, pattypan squash, peppers, and lumps of creamy goat cheese.  Oh, andt he best, most tiny yellow cherry tomatoes ever.  They were like little sweet tomato flavor bombs.  

My hubs had their meatloaf, which is supposedly a bit of a big deal.  We weren't impressed frankly.  I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't blow me away good either.  And a bit dry.  My fish however was excellent.  I know they are known for good seafood preparations and they got it right on this one for sure.  Perfectly cooked and a nice light sauce.

OK, you drive up and sharks circling the chum filled waters comes to mind, but it is what is the norm for buying a car. We knew what we wanted and that helped with the process. We did not get the high pressure the other reviewers report. In the past when we have bought a car, there has been a lot of pressure to put add-ons to the bill - additional warrenties, service contracts, under coating, processing fees. This was all very straightforward with no hidden items on the final sale.

What bumps this up to four stars for me is the way they helped my son (who has virtually no credit) get the best deal with financing. I had to co-sign for the loan, but I had expected that. What made them stand out is they called me the next day and said they found a different financing at a lower rate. I really appreciate that they went out of their way to get the very best deal for us. 

I waited to write this review to see if there have been any problems with the vehicle once my son got it home. His job requires him to dive 200+ miles per day some of it over rural unpaved roads. He has had no problems with the vehicle and it has stood up to the demands that he puts on it. 

I would consider buying a used vehicle from them again.","2014-02-08 21:52:47"

I'll gladly make the trek from south city to O'Fallon to get this delicious, superior and value Thai.

Having been twice, I am ashamed to admit that I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles so I have had that each visit, albeit once chicken and once pork.

The appetizers are delicious.  Have tried the spring rolls, chicken satay and chicken pot-stickers and they were all satisfying.

The waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish.  They ask you on a scale of 1 to 4.  First visit I asked for 3 and the dish was very nice.  Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a ""sinus opening experience"" the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.

The menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being ""not fresh"" I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I've had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.

Each visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.

Walk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.

I've been to Thailand a few times and while you'll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.  It's where I'll be taking my out-of-town guests and where I'll go for takeout when the urge hits. 

Looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their menu choices...unless those Drunken Noodles get me again!","2013-01-28 17:33:26"

Walking in, I am immediately struck by how pretty the place is.  Lots of wood, muted colors... very calming.  Add to that the eclectic mix of music, albeit heavy on classic jazz - Miles, Coltrane, Theolonius - and some classic blues - Billie Holiday, Nina Simone... the overall effect is soothing.  After a hectic day at work, sipping a glass of wine at the bar, I feel like I wandered into a little oasis. I grew up in NYC, so this place definitely takes me back to rainy days in the city where jazz just seemed to be the perfect expression of the day.

So, enough about the atmosphere.  Let's talk about what truly makes unplugged special - the booze. Before writing this review, I have been to unplugged four times.  Every time, I have sat at the bar versus a table.  Nothing wrong with the tables there, but to anyone who knows me then you know what a chatty Cathy I can be .  

Frank, the owner and frequently the bartender, is an absolute joy to chat with about wine.  My first time going here, I ordered a flight of whites.  I was so impressed that Frank poured each glass and then explained a little about the wine I was about to taste.  He then waited until I finished the glass I had before pouring the next.  His passion and knowledge of wine are clearly evident.  In subsequent visits, I have always sat at the bar to be able to chat with Frank or whomever is bartending.  All of the staff that I have encountered have always been warm, knowledgeable, and passionate about wine.

Speaking of the wine... I love that their wines are unusual.  Since Frank is a native German, it is not at all surprising that many of the wines are German.  However, don't expect to see only Rieslings.  There are Gewurtz's, Spatleses, Kabinetts, and a bunch of beautiful German reds that are both unexpected and delightful.  Speaking of the Rieslings, their selection ranges from the traditional sweet and mineral wines to some surprisingly dry one also.  Last night, I had an amazing red - a blend of mostly Grenache, a little Syrah, and a little Mourvedre (an oft overlooked but delightful grape).  

While their wines are a bit pricier by the glass or bottle than what you might expect to pay at Good Oak or Congress, the quality in astronomically better.  If you're on a budget, ask for the house white or house red as they are always fantastic (and nothing like what you might expect of a house wine at a different establishment).","2013-11-14 18:58:32"

We used Yelp to help us find a place for palm reading and a medium. With our limited schedule we let go of the medium and booked 3 sessions of palm and tarot readings with Jessica.

The reading area was a corner of the store that had a curtain blocking it off from the rest of the store. Three of us squeezed into the area and were immediately made comfortable by Jessica.  She was very straight forward and got right into action. Our reading were very interesting and with lots of information that Jessica was picking up from the cards. She gave us plenty of opportunity to ask any questions or get clarification. I really enjoyed the palm readings, she took her time, was very calm and also seemed inquisitive about what she was seeing in our palms. I felt everything that she said was spot on with what I have going on and what I already knew I needed to do. Her reading was the nudge I needed. My daughter and my friend had similar positive and pleasing experiences with her. 

I highly recommend Jessica. 

The store: having lived in towns with amazing gem shops and what used to be called New Age merchandise, I was not anticipating seeing much that interested me. However,  I will say there was a large variety to choose from ( simple stones on a cord to finely crafted jewelry) and I felt their prices were VERY reasonable, especially for a tourist area. I did end up picking up a few gifts as well as some items related to my readings from Jessica. The store was clean, bright and accessible. My fellow shoppers and I wished the customer service was a little less brusque from the one of the young women there. It was a bit of a turn off and did not match the rest of the store vibe, maybe it was a bad day for her. 

I recommend the store for anyone looking for gems, minerals, fossils, jewelry, cards or beads...and of course readings.","2015-05-31 00:45:46"

Went to pay my bill an hour later and the dude with the long beard behind the bar rung me up. My bill was for normal price (and overpriced). He said the order was put it at 3:59 it looked like. He was a total jerk about it with no forgiveness after I told him I was led to believe it was happy hour. Needless to say there was no tip!

I went back, a few days later, shockingly. Ordered a cocktail. A simple old fashioned with brandy. I asked for soco and they didn't have it. So i asked for brandy. Cocktail was good. Get the bill later ... $12 cocktail. For real! It wasn't even an 8oz cocktail. More like a 4oz! And there was a $4 bogus charge on there which i was unaware about when ordering and that long bearded guy again behind the bar told me what it was for after the fact (something to do with adding a higher liquor quantity). I wouldn't have wanted that in the first place!! So again, no forgiveness and forced to pay that bill. Again, zero tip. 

otherwise, you can get takeout beer here and the outdoor couches are ok. But customer service really blows!!! they're so slow and unforgiving and confusing ! I hope that long bearded guy is not a manager. Very pathetic","2016-09-30 22:19:15"

The menu has a huge selection with a lot of variety from plate sized sandwiches (Doner), to lunch combos (soup / sandwich or wraps with fries), to full on dinner plates (the stuffed chicken is absolutely amazing).  There is something there for a variety of tastes and every budget.

This place serves a lot of great Bosnian food (Cevapi) and clearly has some American influences but is largely traditional.  The staff (and most of the regulars) speak Bosnian most of the time which to me is an indication that the food is fairly authentic - and it is unarguably delicious.

You can order at the counter or simply sit for table service.  The first few times we went in, we ordered at the counter then sat but were later encouraged to just be seated.  My one complaint is that the table service can be slow and a little inattentive, especially during the lunch rush so If you need a server to be regularly checking on you to make sure your drink is full you may find this frustrating.

The TVs often have international sporting events and the staff is happy to chat about anything from the whether, to politics, to world/local sports and it's wonderful to hear the perspective of those who haven't been here since birth.  To do so while savoring their culinary contributions is all the more divine.

If you like eastern European cuisine and haven't been to this place, get there right now and try them out.  I recommend the Donner sandwich and an Orangina but anything you get is going to be delicious.","2016-09-21 22:52:22"

We walked up to the ""seat yourself"" sign and found a couch/bench out of the open area. The waitress Sarah found us immediately and offered us drinks.

The atmosphere is pretty relaxed, the beer selection is top notch and the bar games they have are a blast to challenge your friends to...but in the end it comes down to the quality of service and the clientele...and in both cases franklins fails miserably.  From the terrible food, to a handful of very ignorant employees, the people at franklins simply don't know how to appeal to their customers.  Speaking of customers, it's the weirdest combination of obnoxious entitled college kids, neighborhood low lives, and full blown drug dealing gangsters from north Philly. It's like the people that have been flagged from every other bar in a 10 mile radius come here to hang out. The weird crowd spells a recipe for disaster in my opinion and is probably a major contributor to the fights, muggings and robberies that happen there on a fairly routine basis.

 The sliders were good, a little pricey at $3.25 a pop when two definitely aren't going to fill you up. The waffle fries themselves were pretty good, stay away from the cheese sauce though. It was waaay too thick and just had an odd consistency overall. It tasted like the time I tried to make homemade nacho cheese sauce at home, it had a roux consistency but for my personal tastes, didn't pair well with the fries or even taste particularly cheesy.

As per my usual, this review gets three stars. Not because there was anything lackluster about my experience, but because it gives me an opportunity to return in the future and perhaps add more stars.
I arrived during a lull in morning service. This was great because I did not feel the need to rush through looking around, and taking in the menu which has many choices on it. My server Christine was appropriately welcoming and perky-and when I told her it was my first visit she was of course more than happy to answer any questions I might have and give me plenty of time to make my selection. I finally settled on the Irish omelette which contains corn beef hash and cheddar cheese, and because my omelette had potatoes with in it I elected for pancakes as my side paying an additional two dollars to upgrade to one of the many options of pancakes beyond buttermilk. I chose Pecan. 
As I waited for my order, I took a few pictures, checked Facebook, and took time to enjoy the steaming hot cup of coffee that had been placed before me. Their coffee mugs are delightfully original, and if not for the fact that I already own enough coffee mugs to caffeinate a small nation I likely would have purchased a mug on my way out. The coffee brand here is Boyds, brewed fresh and strong. A tip here, if you prefer your coffee a little on the later side, be sure to ask for cream and be prepared to send it down just a touch. 
The interior of The Original  Pancake House is a bit Spartan, however it is warmly painted and still manages to be welcoming. I cannot say as much for the chairs, they are the hard straight back wouldn't variety that don't invite for any prolonged resting of the buttocks .  With tile floors, and large windows the space was, at least this morning, a bit on the chilly side which made me glad that I had opted to leave my hoodie on.
When Christine brought my food, I literally said wow out loud, actually I believe the actual word was wowzers! It is well known by anyone who spends any time with me that I am a big eater, however those of you with a more shall we say, normal size stomach should be prepared to take home a doggy bag. My pecan pancakes were beautifully golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar served on a separate plate from my Irish omelette. I was also left with a small picture of warmed syrup. At first glance my omelette definitely appeared to be overcooked, because it was. However given that it was jampacked with corn beef hash and cheddar cheese it is obvious that the extra cooking time was required. When Christine set down my plate I thought it first it may have been a mistake because this omelette didn't look like any other I have ever eaten, it looked more like a small loaf of sourdough bread. Not because of the color but because of the size . other than my omelette being a bit dry on the edges and of course being a little bit overcooked the only other issue I had is that the way the omelette have been folded I manually had to move melted cheese on to the corn beef once I cut into it in order to blend the flavors together. When I return again to eat here I will see if A different kind omelette comes from the kitchen in the same manner.
As the restaurant begin to fill, I watched the graceful ballet of servers busters and the hostess getting folks welcomed seated and served. My coffee cup never ran empty, my water was also regularly refilled. I especially appreciated how the busser made regular, yet inconspicuous tours of the dining area to make sure things were kept clear.
When it came time for the check, I was pleased to find that it was not a printed receipt but I handwritten ticket, where all of The charges had been totaled at the bottom including the tax.
I don't often go out for breakfast, my husband does not care for pancakes waffles or French toast, and has some sensitivity to eggs. So when I get an opportunity to go out I enjoy trying new places, especially now that I use Yelp it's much easier and I appreciate patronizing local businesses. I will go back to this location.  Since this restaurant appears to primarily please folks in the breakfast arena I will likely not test that theory by coming for any other type of meal. This was an amazing start to a clear, sunny and cold Friday in March. If you're looking for a freshly cooked, stick to your ribs, if you leave hungry it's your own damn fault breakfast give the Original  Pancake House a try","2015-04-03 15:53:59"

My boyfriend and I made sure to order a variety from their menu, and overall I was satisfied but also that I could've made a better choice for our semiannual restaurant week date. I would give Aldine a 3.5 if there were half star ratings.

My choices for the night were the kampachi crudo, onion soup, duck breast, and panna cotta. 

FIRST:
The kampachi was fresh and combined new culinary ideas of textures and flavors. I have had crude dishes in Philadelphia in which the sauce overpowered the freshness of the fish, but this was not the case for Aldine. They nailed the balance.
SECOND:
The onion soup I found far too sour for my palate, and you shouldn't order this expecting something similar to the classic French onion soup. My boyfriend's pork belly option was the clear winner in this case. This is the surf-and-turf (pork belly and squid) of my dreams and definitely the highlight of the night. 
THIRD:
I was surprised at how filling the portion of duck breast was for a Restaurant Week meal. Again, the citrus notes of the sauce did not overpower the flavor of the duck meat and I was able to enjoy a quality cut of meat for its natural flavor. 
FOURTH:
The panna cotta was in all honesty a terrible way to end my meal. It may have been the chef's intention, but the panna cotta was not set at all and I was served a bowl of gelatinous goo. If the flavor was delicious, it may have been forgivable, but I found my dessert to be too salty. 

The staff was very friendly, and gave us a coupon for our next meal. The dimly lit atmosphere was very romantic and quaint. Because this is a new restaurant, I am extremely hopeful that once they settle, Aldine will become a great place to dine.","2015-03-23 01:12:06"

The custom suit made by Gabe fit perfectly. My body isn't an easy fit due to sloping shoulders, one shoulder higher than the other, a barrel chest, and narrow waist. Most suit jackets gape out at the chest when I button them. But not this one, it drapes smoothly, with just enough taper from the chest to the waist. 

Interestingly, of the many bespoke suits I've had made, Gabe was the only craftsman who seemed to notice the idiosyncrasies of my body and adjust accordingly. It was clear he had a complete understanding of what needed to be done and how to do it.

Gabe also successfully rehabilitated my other four suits, making them all fit better and look better in both the pants and the jackets. I couldn't be happier.

Normally, I just pick whatever sounds interesting to write about for the day and go from there, but Yah Mon has been burning a hole in my to-do list for a few months as one of the most perfect dining experiences I've ever had. This place and its lovely owners, Janise and Andre, deserve all the praise they get and then some.

My wife and I, having arrived in Tampa earlier in the evening and consuming our fair share of alcoholic refreshments already, were looking for somewhere to eat between brewery stops. With all the 5 star reviews on Yelp, I singled Yah Mon out and figured we would be fine arriving about an hour before close the Saturday before Valentine's Day. Alas, they were swamped, missing a server (illness), hosting a birthday party, and had just finished clearing a table of 20. Andre welcomed us graciously and informed us we could still order takeout, which we were perfectly fine with. As we were sitting in the waiting area perusing the menu, Janise came out from the kitchen, did a double take, and guffawed at the idea of us not sitting in to dine. She invited us to a table and informed us she would be cooking for and serving us personally. Talk about service.

With our dinner coming so late in the evening and a little liquid encouragement giving us supreme munchies, we were ready to order the entire menu. Luckily, things got off to a gluttonous start when we ordered the chicken patty and were served an additional steak patty in order for them to move through their daily stock. I highly recommend these flaky, golden vessels of carbs and meat. They reminded me of a cross between an English pasty and an Argentinian empanada. For our main, we knew we were going to order one of the platters to sample as many offerings as possible. We settled on the Caribbean chicken platter and were rewarded with a feast of curry and jerk chicken, brown stew, rice, and plantains. The jerk was some of the best I've had, moist and just the right amount of spiciness, and the curried chicken was tasty heaped onto the rice and paired with the plantains for a sweet and spicy combo. The standout of the platter, though, was the brown stew. When I come back to Tampa, I will do whatever it takes to order this again. Maybe two or three plates worth, honestly. It was one of the greatest, most unique items I've ever had the pleasure of ordering at a restaurant, and even if the rest of our visit hadn't been so pleasant, I'd return again and again for that dish alone.

Fortunately, the remainder of our time at Yah Mon continued its excellence. Even after gorging ourselves on all of the above mentioned food, when we saw a massive coconut cake go out to the birthday group, we knew we had to get a slice for ourselves. It was like eating a piece of heaven - light, fluffy, and simply beautiful real coconut flavor in every bite with fresh fruit and a caramel sauce adding even more dimension to an already transcendent dessert. 

Our impeccable food was only outshined by the generosity and care of our hosts. Janise and Andre treated us like family from the time we walked into the door until we were in our departing Uber. They chatted with us about their journey to establish Yah Mon, laughed with us about tales from our recent wedding/honeymoon, and went above and beyond any service I've experienced elsewhere. They gave us hugs when we left, and when my wife jokingly asked Janise to teach her how to make that brown stew, Janise told us to let her know next time we were in town, and she'd schedule some time for us to come by. I have no doubt in my mind she meant every word. If you want a complete dining package when you're in the Tampa area, you need to come to Yah Mon. I know I will every time I happen to be in town.","2017-05-02 00:22:21"

The daycare has classes divided by age of the child. My kiddo seems happy there and she just started, so maybe that's all that really matters. However, there are a some pros and a bazillion and one cons...

FOR THE DAYCARE:
PROS:
- You, the parent, can easily drop off the kid and go for a work out. They're group classes seem to be timed to be just after school starts so it is convenient
- Staff seem to be flexible with your needs if within their restricted hours.
- Entire JCC is enclosed so at least you know when your child is running outside, there is minimal traffic and no strangers wandering about
- Your child's tuition covers the cost of gym membership for you and spouse

CONS:
- Lunches are supposed to be nut free AND meat free
- Lots of school closures for both christian and jewish days off
- Lots of random rules (ex. if your child is wearing a skirt on gym day, forget it. She will be sitting on the sidelines)
- Classes are not anywhere close to racially diverse. AT ALL. 
- Restricted hours: for any household with two working adults, you will have to deal with a 9a to 3:30p day care schedule with an ""early care"" option starting at 8am. This is pretty unbelievable considering the car traffic around here. 


FOR THE GYM:
PROS:
- As above, the link with the daycare seems to be the best reason to use this place
- Sauna (but it is co-ed)
- Several group classes offered

CONS:
- Everything is outdated even though they apparently just renovated the bathrooms. 
- Kiddie pool is kind of a joke... it's just a shallow outdoor pool that is covered with a thin film of dead flies and leaves
- No towel service
- The place reminds me of a YMCA ... from the 1960s. 


Overall though, I'm still using this place primarily due to location convenience and the ease of working out. I don't require a lot in a gym other than just needing the machines to work so this is fine enough for me. But just beware of the many many drawbacks that come along with it.","2012-09-11 18:58:33"

My first visit to Taco Time ever. It was great!  Arrived just as rush hour was starting on a 'taco thursday'. 99 cent tacos...PACKED with meat. I'm comparing to taco bell. Delicious lettuce and tomato and cheese on top. The meat flavor reminds me of west side tamales my Dad would bring home when I grew up (Chicago). 

Dining areas were very clean and well maintained with live plants. Restrooms were clean and well stocked. Pleasant server and efficient kitchen. I highly recommend this Taco Time for great value for your money and your mouth; two tacos and I was stuffed!!

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn't have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant's biggest strength is it's food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I'm sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with.

One of several restaurants owned by Chef John Besh In New Orleans.  From appetizer to entrees all the way to the end, dessert. 

For our appetizer we split the Crab Meat Maison, served with fresh herbs, touch of horseradish and country bread croutons. 

My choice of entree was the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp over Roasted Jalapeño Cheese Grits and Andouille/green onion sausage.  I have never been a fan of grits before.  They have always been kind of bland, this one knocked my socks off. 

The wife went with the Fresh Gulf Fish done Amandine Style.  It was lightly battered with buttermilk and flour, then fried and topped with Almonds in a brown butter sauce.  Served with new potatoes, green beans and roasted vegetables. 

Please, try to save room for dessert.  Somehow we did. With two Cappuccinos we ordered Brendan's Bread Pudding. This is to die for! It is topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and is accompanied by a buttered pecan sauce.  Also ordered the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Tart, made with bittersweet chocolate and topped with Coconut Sorbet.

I ended up abruptly moving to NYC and needing a new phone number and assumed my membership cancelled when I never received an email from the spa. I called the Marlton location while in town on business and asked if those credits would transfer, to which they told me yes. I booked a facial and a massage a week in advance. I left both my phone number and email and when I received a confirmation email about the appointment I assumed all must have been well. I arrived early to my appointment to ensure that my credits were still okay to be used. The receptionist said she had to call Morristown, but did not stop me from going into either my facial OR massage. 

The esthetician, Karen, was incredibly friendly and had a gentle touch. I wish she had done more extractions and really gone to work on my face. I appreciate the gentle-ness, but there's always a painful time during facials that you just have to grin and bear for better results, and I was hoping for more of that. Otherwise, I thought Karen was lovely. I was dismayed that between my facial and my massage there weren't any robes to transfer between rooms, so I got dressed and waited for about ten minutes while Karen tried to find my massage therapist, and then while she turned the room over until he came to get me. 

My massage therapist asked about my concerns and then left  me to change. By the time we started the massage it was already about 2:15. He was good about asking me how the pressure was, but I felt like I've gotten better massages from an airport chair massage. He used a lot of forearm, and little else technique wise. The massage was not thorough in the slightest. No scalp massage, no middle back, parts of my arms and legs were barely covered. I've had enough fifty minute massages to know that this was lacking. The massage ended at 2:50, not even close to fifty minutes (nor sixty if you're counting the ten minute changing time). After I got dressed my massage therapist was outside with a bottle of water, but he did not walk me out the door. He said goodbye in the hallway and I was left wandering in circles (ended up in an employee break room!) before finding my way out front. 

When I went to check out I held my tongue on the massage because I figured I had paid for it a while ago, I would suck it up and chalk it up to a bad but free (minus tip) experience. I was then told by the receptionist that she had yet to get in touch with Morristown regarding my credits. I had a bad feeling about this. When she got ahold of them they told her the only way to access my credits was to have me sign up again. There is no hand and stone in or around New York City (where I live). I was NOT prepared to pay for two services, I would have never made the appointments, and I certainly would have cancelled them had I known the circumstances. I asked why this was not checked ahead of time,or even during my first appointment before I went into a SECOND appointment, and I didn't think it was fair what was happening. A manager was brought over who said she would take care of things and would give me a call before running my credit card (I wanted to leave my tip on it). I assumed she would call me to work out some sort of price. Which is when I would have addressed the poor massage situation. 

I checked my credit card today and they ran my credit card after the appointment without my permission. I am beyond furious and refuse to ever return to this location, and plan on telling everybody I know in the area to avoid it as well. This was an unacceptable situation and I hope that anybody reading this knows to make 100% sure their services are covered before going in.","2018-05-09 16:07:00"

After walking down south street and only finding stores appropriate for those dressing up as things with ""slutty"" attached, we decided to get out of there and hit Columbus boulevards Halloween superstore. 
When we got there we saw that everyone in Philadelphia thought the same thing. After driving around the parking lot multiple times we finally found a spot and then had to wait in line to actually get into the store. What, was Dracula signing autographs? Thankfully the line moved quickly but we entered into chaos. There were people everywhere, Mom's on the phone with their children picking out Disney Princess costumes, Sorority girls getting their handcuffs or nurse hats, and employees dressed up as creepy clowns pointing us in the wrong direction when looking for temporary tattoos. 
Two of my pack had to actually leave the store because listening to the Cha-Cha slide while bumping into people was just too much to deal with. 
I finally located the ""Punk Rock"" section, picked up some Sailor tattoos, a studded cuff and hoped that I would pay a somewhat accurate homage to Axl. 
""Okay, let's go pick up a case and get out of here"" were my words upon exiting.

Their Buddha burritos and Falafel pitas are among my favorites. Their new location at Camino Real marketplace is great too,  although the older one at Old Town was more classic.  

The reason I gave 3 stars instead of a 4.5 or 5 was because of a few ridiculous rules they have.  First,  they regularly email discount coupons but want them to be printed in order to avail the discounts.  I find this very silly.  The name of the restaurant is Natural Cafe and they have messages all over the place to protect the environment.

The sandwich was almost as delicious as I remember from downtown. The steak was well seasoned and wonderful! The whiz and onions were on point!

I have been a member for at least 5 years, maybe even longer and I have never had one bad day nor have I had to fight for space. SouthRac has definitely done a lot of improvements in their facility and every year they get better and better. 

SouthRac has other businesses inside its facility, so depending on what you're looking for, this place can be a one-stop-shop for wellness and fitness. There is a salon, acupuncturist, massage therapist, metabolic testing center and much more.

I typically come in during lunch hour M-F since I work around the area, but lately I've been coming in around 2pm to stay away from the ""resolutioners crowd."" Don't get me wrong, this place is HUGE that it never really feels ""busy"" in there. But I do enjoy the quieter time of the day. Cardio machines are located upstairs which overlooks 2 basketball courts, an indoor track, 2 racquetball courts, circuit weight training machines, open astroturf and the recently added incline ramp -- Shaun T would say ""Amazeballs"" to this. Strength training machines, heavy weights are mostly upstairs and the Group Ex room as well. They have great Group Ex classes with great instructors. If you ever want to try Zumba, take Dulce or Veronica's class because you will be hooked. Just last year, they also became a Les Mills gym that now offers various Les Mills classes. My favorite area would be the ""Bat Cave"". I do a lot of functional training and the Bat Cave is the best place to do this. The Bat Cave is covered with rubber floors which is great for plyometric exercises. In the Bat Cave you'll find battle ropes, rowing machines (another favorite), spin bikes, suspension training equipments, pull-up bars, lifting platforms, GHDs and also free weights. There are numerous plyo boxes, and even agility ladders that is accessible to all the members. I also appreciate that there are plenty of foam rollers for the members to use. In short, whatever it is that you like to do when working out, SouthRac has it. So really, you wouldn't have any excuse as to why you are not working out here.

Staff is very friendly, always greets you with your first name which I think is very personable and inviting. Locker rooms are well maintained with multiple shower stalls. You will also find a sauna in the locker rooms. I have never used the saunas so I couldn't tell you much about these.

Parking can be hard depending on the time of day you come so plan accordingly.  Or just think about it this way -- you're getting in your warm-up walking from your car to the entrance.

As you can tell, I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Try them out yourself and you will not be disappointed.","2015-01-20 06:19:52"

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.
But whats this? 
There are whispers that he no longer cooks for ""Best Taste of Asia,"" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.

No.
No, it can't be! 
I need to score - one .. final .. hit..

Life ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?
Why am I here?
What is Cheeze Wiz?
Its done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.

Zaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that's silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. 

Zaika 's appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.
 
I've become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn't too soft. It's nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don't mind at all.

The menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.
Though some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. 
The head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.

I have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.

The bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for ""Best taste of Asia,"" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. 

Only good things can come of this, only good things.

P.S.
ZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. 
However, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios. They are ungodly good.","2010-08-20 19:16:04"

I had never tried Cambodian food but found the spice blends to be EXTREMELY agreeable and complimentary to the meats and veggies they were cooked with. Get the meatballs. Wrap them in lettuce and dip them in the spicy sweet sauce. Get the caramelized pork in coconut. Get the 4 mushroom lemon grass pork in the banana leaf. The only reason I would NOT reorder these items is to try the rest of the menu. I want everything. Byob (though we didn't last night, couldn't find a liquor store) is a nice option, and the family that owns Khmer is SO accommodating and cool. I expected Khmer to be sort of a hole in the wall, due to the lack of any Yelp interior pictures, but I actually found it to be very cute. I caaaaan't wait to go back. Also, for anyone deducting stars due to wait times, wouldn't you rather your food be cooked to order than sitting on some cart all day?

OK, maybe I kind of freak out over them, but I was expecting to have a great experience at batch because, let's face it, places that specialize in cupcakes tend to specialize in them for a reason! Upon entering the store and seeing the beautifully presented selection of organic, paleo, and vegan cupcakes, I was convinced that I was about to have my socks rocked off. Well, presentation isn't everything...

At $3 a cupcake, I was expecting to eat a rich, flavorful, moist cupcake. Instead, my husband and I agreed that they were bland, unbalanced, and a little dry/crumbly. I was, as any 7 month pregnant woman allowing herself a treat would be, pretty disappointed. The cupcakes we ate were their flagship vanilla cupcake and their lemon cupcake. The lemon cupcake was not even slightly tart. It tasted of slightly bitter lemon rind and lots of sugar. There was no tartness or even the slightest bit of salt to balance the flavors. The vanilla cupcake had no pleasant vanilla aroma; I would say it tasted like pure sugar. 

They present a beautiful appearing product, but unfortunately the flavor is not up to par. I would prefer my own 30 minute Betty Crocker vanilla cupcakes and homemade buttercream frosting to the Batch cupcakes any day.

We were seated pretty quick for a Saturday night which was great.  Our server was attentive and patient as we were trying to figure out what we wanted.  A great atmosphere and location in Germantown.  

We started with the cheese curds and breaded mushroom appetizers, they were good, but I thought they had too much breading though I would still recommend. The sauce served with each was very tasty. 

We ordered two deep dish pizzas - the Capone and the Deerborn Station.  The pizza was pretty good.   Everyone at the table liked it, but we're not blown away.  I did like the ingredients and the sauce was good.  I think the issue was the crust - it was was pretty hard and overly crispy.  I had a hard time cutting it with a knife.

First of all, I suppose I should begin by saying ""shame on me"" for not trying this place sooner!  Mrs. S and I stopped in last Sunday with her parents in tow.  They were visiting and her father had always wanted to check out Old Town St. Charles, so we made our way down to Hendricks BBQ!

First off, if you aren't familiar with Old Town, parking is a bit of a mystery here.  You will need to look for a sign for public parking and go down the hill, and then make your way to the best spot you can find from there.  There is no place to park on the cobblestone street!

As far as food is concerned, there is plenty to choose from.  The in-laws mistakenly ordered family portions of green beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and sweet potato casserole with their Smoked Turkey dinners.  I say mistakenly because the waitress didn't do a very good job of explaining to them what they were ordering.  There was confusion over which meals came with sides, and which did not, and my mother in law talks more than she listens, so I cannot fault the waitress entirely!  

Mrs. S and I, on the other hand, ordered ""The Whole Shebang.""  It is exactly what it sounds like, a sample platter featuring each kind of meat they offer for BBQ.  There was a plentiful assortment of brisket, smoked turkey, ribs, sausage, and pulled pork.  The sauces were on the table, and each had their own appeal.  I enjoyed the combo of the honey bbq with the pulled pork, the dry sauce was great on the brisket, and the turkey went well with the house sauce.  My favorite was the sausage with their spiciest sauce.  

The meal also came with 4 sides, each much smaller than the family sized portions my in-laws were served!  Our selection was the sweet potato casserole, corn casserole, baked beans, and....Hell I can't remember!  I especially liked the baked beans and corn casserole, Mrs. S loved the sweet potato casserole.  We both ate the other side, whatever it was.  

The atmosphere here was really nice.  There was music playing but not overpowering, and honestly I really enjoyed it.  

My only complaints are with the service, and even these aren't beyond repair.  Initially, after being seated, it took several minutes to be acknowledged by a server.  For me this is a big deal, it sets the tone for the service, and it's the first thing I notice when dining out.  I will say, once our server, her name was Sarah, appeared, she did a decent job of keeping our glasses full and making sure we had everything we needed, although it seemed that the further into our meals we got, the longer we went between check ins.  Then, there was the issue with not taking the time to clarify the issues with the sides, which resulted in my in-laws ordering $22 worth of side items!  

The final complaint with service is the failure to at least ask if we were splitting the check.  This is another aggravation of mine, and maybe it is just me, but when two couples are sitting down for dinner, it seems like common sense to ask if the check needs to be split.

On a final note, I was pleased to see that Hendricks BBQ uses Yelp! Check-In discounts.  The $5 off our meal was a nice incentive. 

My closing thoughts on Hendricks BBQ are simple.  I loved the food.  The atmosphere is very inviting and I cannot wait to go back.  Today, I saw that Ian P. wrote an update on his review for Hendricks BBQ, where he mentioned that he is the Duke of this location.  I say, not for long Ian P.

I had a bbq pork taco, a buffalo chicken taco, and a house salad (with tabasco vinegarette! who knew such a thing could exist, and be so delicious at that).  All of this came to $9.

I tried the banana and fell in love with it. It's not an overly sweet cupcake but more of a rich flavor from the banana. Well, that was a few weeks ago and tonight we stopped by the location after dinner at Taqueria Del Sol. 12 South is really and up and coming place, isn't it? 

The store is located next to Dapper James (aka Reese Witherspoon's fancy store). The Sprinkles cupcake shop has the infamous cupcake ATM. Whoever came up with this creation is marketing genius. I remember when they came out with the first one in Beverly Hills and it was on all the news sites. Now Nashville is lucky enough to have one. And the people of Nashville must love using it, because I've seen tons of Instagram/Facebook/Twitter pictures of people using it. Funny enough, when we stopped by around 8pm on a Wednesday night, there was a line of people using the ATM, taking pictures, taking selfies. At one point, the line was LONGER to use the cupcake ATM than to order from the counter inside. At it was 37 degrees outside! 

Anyway, the inside of the store is pretty small. I think this part used to be an alleyway and they made it into the Sprinkles store. I was boring and ordered the banana cupcake again. I skimmed the counters and was only seeing chocolate stuff and this might sound crazy, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolate. Of course, after we ordered I saw the strawberry and the vanilla. I will have to try those next time. My friend (who is gluten free) was with us and got the gluten free red velvet cupcake and said it was very good for gluten free, nice and moist. Phillip got the captain crunch ice cream in a waffle cone. The cone was nearly falling apart and the girl making it behind the counter asked him if he wanted a different one, but it took it anyway. It take a little time for them to pack up the cupcakes. The presentation is worthy of the $3.75 price tag. I wished the bag had a couple napkins in it, however. 

This is a great addition to the neighborhood and Nashville. I think they'll have no problems bring in business from all the foot traffic along 12 South. I also think they aren't in competition with the other cupcake places, such as Gigi's because this isn't so focused on a huge blob of icing on top. The flavors here are more simple and clean, in my opinion. I might even try out that ATM (maybe with a selfie too!).

(PS- the cupcakes are more of a value compared to the ice cream. One scoop for $3.75 is pretty funny in my opinion.)","2016-01-07 22:32:51"

First of all, the way the taps are mounted on the wall is really cool.  (You can see it in the pictures.)  The sheer number of taps also made the beer snob in me very happy.  I was very excited to try Ballast Point's Big Eye IPA and Great Divide's Hercules.  Yum!

The second thing that made my visit great was the fact that they have one of those crazy addictive video game machines with Photo Hunt on it.  I'm not going to lie, I'm helplessly addicted to those silly things and I love having them around.  This shouldn't be as big of a deal to me as it is.  :)

But, most importantly, the servers were great.  They were attentive, talkative, and just generally friendly.  When I had a bit too much and knocked over the remainder of a beer at the end of the night, I apologized to the bartender and she said ""It's no big deal!  All I have to do is throw a towel on it!  Boom!  It's done!""  Some bartenders act like you've ruined their day just by making them lift a towel, so it's nice to have someone who just takes it in stride.

The food was simply average, the prices too high, and service almost non-existent. I was very disappointed in this place and won't go back.
I went there for lunch and got to the point where I started to wonder if the waiter had forgotten about me, and the other customers waiting. The soup was too salty, the dumplings too doughy and without enough ""stuff"" in them to give them flavor, and the chicken basil was too dry. The veggies just average. Since I mentioned the chicken basil I should add it wasn't even what I ordered. I ordered the shrimp. I didn't say anything, because a.) I was really indifferent about which of the four (veggie, shrimp, beef, chicken) I got, and b.) I didn't want it to be a hassle, and I certainly didn't want the wait to be even longer. So I didn't say anything. At the end, the waiter realized he gave me the wrong dish, and took 10% off the chicken price. Whatever. Had he appeared while I was eating to either refill my water, or ask me how my lunch was I would have said something and added, ""no biggie, just don't charge me the higher shrimp price"".
Mistakes happen, no problem. 
The prices are a few bucks higher than what they should be. If this place was in some generic suburban strip mall, I think most of the positive reviewers would trash this place, but since it is in a hipster neighborhood people say it's great. Sort of like the Seinfeld episode where George convinces attractive models that he once dated a now-deceased fellow model and thus gets ""in the club"". Women looked at George and said ""well, since he dated one of us he must be a stud"". Same deal here, put a place in a cool neighborhood and somehow people think the food tastes better. 
One last thing, this place does NOT take credit cards. Be warned. Don't get how in 2014 restaurants don't take credit cards.","2014-07-14 17:30:17"

They have outside seating and the atmosphere if the inside is pretty much the same as any other Mexican restaurant. 

The reason I give El Camino 5 stars is because of their drinks and food. They have great mojitos, one of the best I have had and decent margaritas. Our bartender was pretty good and attentive to us. We didn't order any entree items but got a few apps and their guacamole and chips was incredible. We also had jalapeno poppers were really spicy and I wasn't a fan, but my friend loved them.

The fish is very fresh and the rolls are as beautiful as they are delicious.  I have celiac disease so I must eat gluten free.  The sushi chefs here show a great deal of interest and care in making sure I am able to eat safely.  This restaurant has gluten free soy sauce available as well as gf soy paper.  This is fantastic because I dislike seaweed paper but rice paper often contains gluten.
Baylor (my favorite sushi chef) takes great pride in his skill and service.  Night after night, he genuinely seems to enjoy creating versions of rolls that are safe for me to eat and that he knows I will like.  In fact, every employee I encountered bent over backward to give great service and demonstrate they understood my special dietary needs and remembered what I like and how I like it.  I feel very welcome there.
Too often, restaurants offer a ""gluten free menu"" which is really just a list of items from the regular menu made without this or that; usually the best part of the recipe is missing leaving just a slab of plain, sauceless meat or worse, a plain salad.  Not so at the Tokyo Japanese Steak House sushi bar.  
I had heard that another local sushi bar was better so I tried it.  I did not review that restaurant because I don't enjoy writing negative reviews.  The sushi was fishier, the service was ""bored"" the counter wasn't clean and in spite of other reviews I have read, Tokyo charged less for the items I ordered.
A final note: Google maps shows the location as President Place and Jim Parker Dr. but it is actually in a strip mall on the corner of President Place and Potomac.
Go and enjoy!  And if you want gluten free, ask for Baylor and tell him Cindi from California sent you!","2012-07-20 03:57:33"

Walking the streets of uptown it began to rain and I soon found myself seeking refuge in the confines of one New York Pizza (in New Orleans! Don't these folks know how we southerners feel about carpet bagging types?!)

Anyway, I forgave the cultural transgression the moment the lively bar staff opened their arms to me. I believe one was named Iggy and I immediately took to her as she obviously cared for cats as well, she talked about hers quite a bit and even sang a ditty about him (though I must confess I think naming your cat simply ""pussy"" is a bit of a copout).

The other waitstaff were a calming influence as well (even though some sported ""ink"" which I personally find to be of low class, but some of their crudely doodled images did make me giggle and a pregnant employee gave one heck of a backrub).
Enough about the service (a mix of moxie, puckishness, and downright questionability) how was the food? I ordered something called a pizza pie with pepperoni. It was a circular dough based concoction with red sauce, cheese, and discs of the aforementioned meat topping. And it was tasty. Flaky, buttery crust. Cheesy, chewy goodness and the pepperoni? Don't take my word for it but I think this combination could really catch on with the go go kids of today!

In addition they plied with me seven different beers on draft (all good save for something called tin roof which tasted like, well, a tin roof), five well poured jack Daniels, a complimentary car bomb, and several ""mystery shots"" one of which I think contained Spanish fly.

Six hours, and several disastrous rounds of ""shake a shake"" later, I left well fed, well tended, and danced out. Good food, great times and leftovers for Dr. Tinkles.

Addendum: The leftover pizza pie caused Dr. Tinkles to stop his yowling (and pretty much all other biological functions. RIP Dr. Tinkles)","2013-02-22 02:53:57"

I ordered a Fresh Cobb wrap that came with lettuce(you pick which one you want), tomatoes, egg, bacon, avocado, and your choice of salad dressing. It was pretty nice but the bacon flavoring was a bit too overpowering, which somewhat lessened the appeal of the wrap.

Returned to New Orleans and joined...  Service- 2-3 ppl behind the counter looking down.  Circuit- 30/12 minute areas used as personal gym, when I attempt to get to the next station (in order), the other members get irritated or will not move, they will not wipe down machine because they are annoyed. The time I spend walking to the counter for the staff/manager to say, our policy is... (NOT OUR PROBLEM), we have to stay at the counter... is using up my gym time.  Then they share that everyone complains about it... and another member curses out members who do not move (put him on the payroll and I will schedule time with him!).  There is a white board that states a policy, they CHOOSE not to enforce. I even started attempting to find you a solution; guess what you have camera's in those areas????  You can monitor from the counter. I joined because of the 24 hr circuit availability and the service I received in Charlotte. One FB post, 3 conversations with staff and 2 suggestion box submissions later, I had to cancel my membership.  I guess you have enough members.  What really annoys me is, I recommended PF circuits to about 50 ppl when I returned... I am so embarrassed.  If everyone says the program is broken, get rid of it; continuing to market something you cannot manage is false advertising.  Throw out the red/green light and white board that says you will ask someone to leave or cancel their membership.

I was not greeted at all or even given a friendly smile. Just simply a ""what you need?""

NO massage whatsoever and from my normal experience at other similar nail salons, they seemed to be skipping steps I usually am accustomed to. She finished in under 15 minutes for $25 dollar pedicure. Not acceptable.

Onto the manicure which was equally horrendous. It probably took her 6 minutes and was not pleased. In all, I spent $45 and got a VERY low quality service.

On top of these things, the lady kept pressuring me to add on other services like an eyebrow wax, which I just had done elsewhere, and she looked annoyed when I turned her down. She also tried to get small upcharges added on and when I refused she just shook her head.

The Bad: So while the renovation looks nice on the surface, it may have not been the best quality job. Half the toilet paper holder just randomly fell off the wallet and keys stopped working randomly. However, what started bleeding from bad to ugly was when we came back from the beach with like 20 pounds of gear to find our keys not working, called the desk to bring us up new cards and were told they are too busy to be bothered and we needed to come downstairs. when we did, we found ""manager"" aaron lollygagging at the front. he was totally rude and dismissive. customer service level was on like negative 3.

The Ugly: The advertise themselves as being on a beach. They lie. They three some sand on a two inch jetty and called it a beach. No bueno.

All the servers were very nice, including the folks that greet you when you first walk in. They were friendly, helpful, and delivered our orders timely and accurately. The prices here are not cheap, they are not super expensive, I would categorize them as somewhere in the middle.

Oysters were little on the small side. I'm not sure if that's quality issue or a time of year issue. The nachos were a big portion for an appetizer, and were loaded with lots of good stuff including pork. We seriously enjoyed digging into these nachos.

Don't get me wrong, I still continue to go here despite the ""meh"" food, but the attractiveness of Mumbai Bistro lies nearly entirely in the location and the price (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).

I am definitely glad that there is place in walking distance from both Jefferson and Pennsylvania hospital that serves ready-made Indian food I can grab on my lunch break. The standard hospital cafeteria fare can grow old quickly, and I often fantasize about a delicious curry when I contemplate grabbing something predictable from the hospital cafe. 

And I suppose it's a smart business strategy to serve Indian food that is palatable to pickier eaters or people who don't normally enjoy spicy cuisine, but for someone like me who loves Indian food for its vibrant and complex flavors, the food served here is a bland facsimile of familiar favorites. The malai kofta and the mixed vegetable curry are probably the best meatless dishes served here, but even those lack the expected richness and texture. The Gobi Malasa tends to be overcooked and mushy and the paneer masala is downright watery. The naan is somewhat soggy and seems like it has been microwaved.

I don't like giving bad reviews, and I want this place to remain in business, but I think there are some very easy fixes they could do to improve the food here, namely not watering down dishes and not using a microwave to heat up naan. I think it is great that they do not use butter or ghee, but I've also made vegan Indian food in my own home that was more flavorful than this, so I don't find the health claims to be a valid excuse for blandness. I think the concept of a cheap vegan & celiac-friendly buffet that is 5$ a pound is a fantastic idea, but I don't think that it should come at the cost of flavor and consistency.

If you work close by and you're really craving some cheap and fast Indian food that meets your dietary restrictions, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to come here, but if you have your choice of Indian restaurants, I'd definitely recommend choosing a different one.","2014-07-31 02:22:29"

We parked out in the back lot for $16 for 24 hours and walked through all of Union Station to Marriott - no ramps, LOTS of stairs! Tried to check in at 3:45pm and no rooms were ready (checkout is 11am though so that is 5 hours to clean rooms). The rep said she would call us when the room was ready (only about 10 minutes). Our room was fine-clean & pleasant. Bathroom was a bit small, I really prefer 2 sinks at hotels. I find I spend about 50-60% of my hotel time in the bathroom getting ready for various outings so I wouldn't mind my room to be smaller & bathroom bigger. I did love all the cubbys around the sink to store everything. Shower had good pressure and again everything was spotless. (maybe that's why it takes 5 hours to clean rooms!)

The lobby was gorgeous and the bar out there had great bites and nice wine choices. Was really handy to grab drinks & an app to have while getting ready for dinner. The Metro station is RIGHT out the back door, through the parking lot and you are there. $7.50 per person buys you unlimited rides for 24 hours and that was a great deal for us. Everything we wanted to do was a couple of blocks from one or another of the stations and the subway attendants were incredibly FRIENDLY! That was the most amazing part. Chicago CTA workers literally act like they cannot see you. You can stand directly in front of them and speak into their face and you will feel like maybe you suddenly became invisible. The nicest guy ever helped us with tickets and then chatted with us about the Cards game while we waited for the train. The train was clean and I didn't smell even a trace of the urine stench so familiar to the CTA. Outstanding experience and what a deal! 

There was a toronado warning while we were getting ready and hotel employees came through the halls banging on doors and asking us to wait in the hallway. They were really serious too. They kept banging and if you didn't come out, they would come in to see if anyone was in the room. They kept checking to make sure we were staying out there too.

The first time I ordered they slathered my burger with Mayo which was really upsetting because you are given the option on GrubHub to choose your toppings and I did *NOT* select it. However the quesadilla was SO AMAZING that I had to give them another chance.

The second time I ordered I typed in all caps ""ABSOLUTELY NO MAYO"" and my meal was superb. Their burgers are fresh - no pre-made patties here - and everything is just great right down to the side of fries. (I don't eat coleslaw so I can't speak to if it's any good.)

The *THIRD* time I ordered was a disaster. They forgot my shake, they brought regular coke instead of diet. I was at a party so lots of people had ordered, so we got a free 2 liter. The delivery guy had to leave and come back again and it was really frustrating. GrubHub actually refunded part of my order.

The next time I ordered, I called first and told the manager what had happened previously. He sent out a free 2 liter to replace the OTHER free 2 liter, and this time everything was perfect again.

The LAST time I ordered, the quesadilla was a disaster. They hardly put anything inside of it so it ended up just being mostly tortilla.

So, as you can see, it seems to be a luck of the draw situation. The reality is that it's usually quite good (surly delivery guys almost every time though), and one of the few 24 hour places in West Philly.

*UPDATE* - I have upped my review by a full star. Here's the deal. Things still tend to be hit or miss here, but the hits are so delicious I can deal with the misses. I had another quesadilla disaster, but I had a really solid conversation with the owner and he sincerely wants his customers to know that they are working HARD to make things the way they want them. He also sent out a replacement. You know, in this day and age when a small business owner actually give a damn, it means a lot to me. A LOT. They could send out mistakenly prepared food every time and as long as it wasn't legitimately BAD - which it never really has been - I would remain loyal because I know that they care and they're trying.

So I really do recommend you give Axis a try. We've got enough shitty McDonald's around, you know? Support locally!","2013-03-04 05:15:32"

There was only a set of 3 drawers in the bathroom area and a very narrow closet (with only half a dozen or so hangers). I was here for a conference, which lasted several days, so I brought a good amount of clothes and really had to struggle to put things away.

The bed was comfortable but there were no side tables - only side ledges - so that limited where we could store things, as well. The TV was nice; I loved the swiveling arm that it was attached to! The floor was quiet and we didn't have any problems with noise. Housekeeping was a little inconsistent in terms of when they came to clean and one day the room was not serviced at all. There was no ""please service this room"" door tag, only one for ""privacy please.""

The continental breakfast was decent  and I was very pleased to see V8 as one of the juice options! It was also a very short drive away from the KOP Mall and the Valley Forge Radisson/Casino, where my conference was held. The staff at the front desk was pleasant and the check-in/check-out process was quick.

He was right -- Plaza is a very solid choice for nearly any kind of sub you're looking for with great prices. 

Once you get inside it looks more like a vintage inspired game room, a kids bedroom. It certainly doesn't look like something I'd find at a mall or a bodega which is what alternatively what I imagined when someone says 'A New Yorker walked into Santa Barbara and opened a sandwich joint.'  It's incredibly welcoming, with bottle caps everywhere, made into signs and overflowing from bubblegum machines, photos of skyscrapers, handwritten signs, and even a couple of booths stuffed in there somewhere.  

Speaking of menus, they have a few options and even if it's not on there, or you can't find it, they'll make it.  It seems as though they have nearly everything.  Meatball sure.  Grilled, yup (panini press and everything).  And then you see that a small is $3 or something and a large 12"" is about $7. SOLD! 

I was very happy with my Turkey, Bacon, and Avocado.  I had to, this is California.  If I go a day without avocado I risk shriveling up and drying.  First things first, GET SOMETHING WITH BACON ON IT.  The bacon was great--thick, crunchy.  I loved it.  Most of our sandwiches were hits.  A dip hit while the cheesesteak came out more like a dip. With cheese. The meatball was impressive, for someone who is not normally inclined to order one.  

Skip the Roy's Lemonade ($2) --it wasn't very good.  But I mostly blame a cartoon named Roy for that... And there are dozens of indie sodas and beverages of all kinds to choose from.  

They don't actually have everything.  Someone asked if they had coleslaw. Evidently they don't have coleslaw. Or Swiss cheese. (Instead the use Parmesan?)  I'm not sure how that works, but in addition to subs and the sodas they have salads and hot dogs on the menu as well.

I received an email from Thrillist announcing FREE burgers on 500 Degrees' opening day....it's a couple of doors down from the dance studio...I need to eat before class so let me give it a whirl!

There was no line when I arrived.  I liked the setup of communal tables and for those of you afraid to share a meal with a stranger you can grab a stool at a counter facing a wall.  After already researching the spot before I stepped in the door I knew I wanted a Combo 5 (500 Burger Medium Well - Truffle Fries - Diet Coke).  The burger was smaller than I thought it would be but it was a perfect size for me.  The brioche was a bit dry and not really flavorful and I ended up taking the top part off (too much bread).  The patty was juicy with just the right amount of pink.  Alas, I couldn't taste any of the house sauce on the burger and it was quite bland.  

The Truffle Fries...well that's another story....it was an orgasmic delight to my tongue!  I've never tasted ANYTHING like this before!  I was literally licking my fingers!  Just the right amount of salt and the dipping sauces (mayo based) were good....but just interfered with the essence of truffle slathered on the fries.  Next time, I'd skip the dipping sauces (which were included in my order).

The other thing that impressed me (besides the fries) was the employee they had cleaning cleaning CLEANING!  That's all she did was wipe down the tables and she was QUICK - picking up dropped napkins (people can be SO rude) - checking the bathroom after each customer to give a quick wipe down etc.  She was phenomenal!  

I can see this joint being a hot spot for the Boozed Up At Two AM Need A Place To Grub Crowd.  The burgers will taste delummy after a night of drinking.  I would return for the fries and did recommend that everyone I know go just for the fries!","2010-03-26 12:34:42"

The hostess sat us down at a table in the center area of the restaurant along side the wall. Hardwood floors and ""beachy"" decorations including a hammerhead, a diver,  and signs are everywhere.

The floor seemed give with each step taken. 

We looked over the appetizers and decided to have either the Table Side Guacamole
or Crab Rangoon. Decision was made easier when we were told by our waitress that the guacamole is no longer on the menu. A little disappointing. Crab Rangoon it was.
6 nice size rangoons arrived with a nice slaw on the side. Very tasty.

They have a pretty big menu of most deli style sandwiches. They also sell sodas and chips. The only thing that's hard for me is, there never seems to be a go to person to order your food. Sometimes you're placing an order to a short person over their 5' tall reach in cooler, which is strange. Other times you order at the register, other times the guy in the back wake over and asks you. I really am not sure about that, I hope they can figure out the organization because it gets awkward for customers when several people are in there standing around at lunch time.

Food: great fries, all sandwiches are oversized. Soul food Friday is a thing here, but I have no idea how it compares.","2016-08-16 11:54:31"

Pairing-up hash browns And toast as one selection, was an act of Jerry Bob genius.

Ladyfriend had tomatoes as one of her items, and got a nice 4 or 5 good-sized slices and was just about thrilled.

I'm not one of those awful folks who go to these places just to chat endlessly with the poor waitresses, and if I was, I'd be disappointed here, for they're just too busy for chit chat, yet maintain a good esprit de corp.

The take out service was fast for a Sat night. We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.
The steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. 
The beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao's chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. The flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  The fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.

To someone that takes advantage of those extra perks and visits the gym frequently, the price is well worth it. It is a rare occasion if the gym is too crowded for me. Obviously, the hours from 5-7pm when everyone is getting done work are pretty busy, which makes the parking lot a chore and a bit annoying but hey!, If you are going to work out you shouldn't mind the extra cardio.

TV channels are lacking and the connection is poor on the treadmills. Plus, the large TVs play the same advertisements repeatedly.

Their wine selection is enormous and can be a bit overwhelming, but they have a fantastic staff.  They are always friendly and willing to help you find whatever you need.  Not only do they have a great variety of excellent wine, but I find myself searching for the cheaper bottles towards the bottom of the shelves and I can still find so many great choices.  

Now for my favorite part....the craft beer section.  Holy. Crap.  I could spend hours in this area of the store.  I love beer and often can't find my favorite craft brews at most stores.  At Total Wine, I can't think of one beer that I have looked for and couldn't find.   Awesome variety and their prices are stellar.  Far better than any grocery store in the area (ahem, Publix).  Sometimes, I peruse the beer section at Whole Foods for some things to try and then go to Total Wine to find them at least a dollar or two cheaper.

I don't drink liquor as much as I drink wine and beer, but their selection of liquor is no different than the rest of the store.  You can find anything you need and I've found the prices better here than any liquor store around here.

Chick-fil-a used to be my favorite fast food chicken sandwich, that was until I found PDQ! I still think Chick-fil-a is a good sandwich, don't get me wrong, but PDQ is probably twice as good, and it is definitely not twice the price.

I still love the waffle fries and PDQ does not have Chick-fil-a sauce, but I am sure that I will be making less stops at Chick-fil-a now that I found PDQ.

Growing up in Michigan, we did not have Chick-fil-a. That being the case, I immediately became a fan upon moving to Florida. I have even gone so far as drawing cow spots on blank paper and taping them to by business suit to get my free chicken sandwich.

I always go with the #1 and cover that baby in the Chick-fil-a sauce. I also give my fries a hefty dose of salt and pepper and then proceed to dip them in the Chick-fil-a sauce. I have it down to a science. I even started making my own fried chicken sandwiches at home and took steps to make them more Chick-fil-a-ish.

Now that I found PDQ I have a huge internal conflict. I sure hope Chick-fil-a can drop the price of their #1 by a little bit, and then they may win my heart back, even though PDQ has a leg up on quality.","2014-01-20 15:16:00"

Once the doors opened I was quickly seated at a table for three, and they gladly accommodated my party of three when we asked to be seated at a booth instead. Overall, the service was satisfactory, albeit slightly scattered and overburdened.

I ordered the Roasted Black Garlic Tonkotsu and I quite enjoyed it. Good flavor and toppings and just the right amount of salt -- I drank the broth at the end, which is something I won't do if it's too salty. Portion size was good, as I left feeling sated, but not full.

Price wise, I don't mind paying ~$11 for a bowl of good Ramen, although I do hope they'll be able to lower the price a little in the future. I will, however, note that the drink prices are unreasonably high -- no one at my table ordered drinks because of it.

If you can get in line early or don't mind waiting, a while I'd definitely recommend trying Raijin Ramen at least once, as in my opinion it's one of the better options for Ramen in Tucson (and currently my favorite, although I still need to try others)...you might want to skip drinks in favor of a lower bill or spending the money on appetizers instead, though.

I'm glad to see a local business with good food have a successful opening. Hopefully they'll be able to expand their hours and menu (dessert options, please), as well as adjust some of their pricing after they've been open for a while.","2018-02-13 20:55:43"

I have to say the Pizza is well worth the wait.  Sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes, others 45, sometimes upwards of an hour but the pizza is always amazing.  

The bar area is great.  It kind of reminds me of the dives my grandfather would take me to so he could grab a beer really quick when he was out running errands for my grandmother.  Smokey, dimmely lit, but delightful and lots of character.  There's always music playing, the walls have all sorts of customer art and funny messages on them from the many visitors both in town and out of town.  I think I could spend hours just reading all of the messages in on the walls in the dining room and the bathroom.  Either way I doubt I'd stop laughing.   

Late night the place really comes alive. Each time I've been there after 9 I've always left with a great memory and a great story.  The bar always has cheap pitcher specials to take you into the night during those long shuffle board tournaments or Golden Tee rounds.

When I walked in the man who worked behind the counter greeted me with a huge smile, he was so excited to see me and was beyond helpful.  He described all the dishes and even let me taste test the very juicy Chicken Marsala before I made my final decision. I decided on the Veal Parmesan because I wanted something covered in marinara sauce, I absolutely love marinara sauce.  As a side I choose the beef lasagna, imagine my excitement when he told me that my options for sides were pizza or lasagna! The meal was topped of with a giant piece of bread that was toasted on the spot and another layer of marinara sauce, of course! 

Everything was so yummy!! My craving was totally satisfied! The Veal was tender and perfectly breaded; the sauce was a bit sweet and very savory.  The lasagna practically melted in my mouth and the bread! I had to tell my roommate that she was only allowed one more bite of the bread because she was trying to steal it from me.  Another fabulous part about Cafe Nino is the portions are huge! I had lunch for the next day and it was just as tasty. Not to mention how affordable it was!

I admit that I was stuck in pricing from the 90s and didn't plan to spend what we did on this aspect of the wedding, but now I know I'd easily pay much more for the quality we received. (Side note: we skimped on the video people and got what we paid for).

Gavin deejayed the event, but the overall company gave us real peace of mind from our very first phone call. Their online planning tool taught us what events we'd need music for, and they even provided all of the music and equipment for the ceremony. 

On our RSVP form, we had asked our guests, ""What song is guaranteed to make you get up and dance?"" - a question we weren't sure we'd ever get answered, let alone use at the event. However, their responses flowed in, and we sent them along to Gavin. Not only did he use every song - which kept our floor filled all night - but he mixed them so expertly that the beats seemed to match song to song to song in short intervals. The requests from guests weren't even all dance-friendly, but he made them danceable!!! We really had a pro dance party there thanks to him. 

Above all, it must be mentioned that our event was no typical affair for a deejay. I wish I could say we made it easy on him, but at least 5 different people had surprises that Gavin had to keep secret and straight from the next.  This could have led to several miscues and mistakes - but not on Gavin's watch. He nailed every single cue with the perfect song intro or mic placement.  All of this while playing master of ceremony. 

Gavin, Carly, and team, we cannot thank you enough for what you did for us. People are still talking about the wedding almost a whole month later, and everyone wants us to know that we had the greatest DJ.  We are so lucky, and could not be more grateful. 

THANK YOU!!!!","2015-01-06 01:27:12"

We waited forever to get into this place which served me a relatively tasteless burger on an incredibly soggy McDonald's quality bun and the saltiest fries I have ever eaten. Yes, truffle oil is delicious, but pouring it over burned, greasy fries does not a delicious, 16 dollar meal make. We won't be back.","2014-04-19 17:34:50"

""Sunshine"" made fudge, sang, and entertained us the whole time. My kids kept saying how this was the best fudge they have ever had. It was smooth and delicious. Not at all dry or grainy like other places. 
I was very impressed with the customer service as well. We bought several flavors to take home. It is too difficult to pick just one! 
I would definitely recommend stopping in.","2018-07-27 19:44:05"
